This is just a short test; I'm beginning to publish my blog via Emacs Org mode rather than Jekyll because&#x2026; well, because I don't enjoy updating Ruby, and blogging is something that I (partially) do for my own relaxation and enjoyment.
</p>

<p>
So&#x2026; welcome to the new blog. To those few of you subscribed to my blog as a feed, apologies for the largely content free post.
</p>

<p>
If this works I'll be updating as I go along with actual posts, as well as the obligatory posts on how the blog works and why I've set it up as I'm planning to.
</p>

<p>
Remind me why every developer feels the need to do that, again?
