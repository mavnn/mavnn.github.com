<p>
A short update this time. <a href="https://gitlab.com/mavnn/caldance/-/issues/3">Gregg Bremer</a> (hi Gregg!) pointed out that running <code>nix run</code> on his linux machine resulted in an error about not being able to find <code>libssl</code>.
</p>

<p>
This neatly highlights one of the weak spots of Nix; while an excellent packaging solution, it isn't perfect. Nix sandboxes your packages by altering the path environment variable, but not everything is located via that mechanism.
</p>

<p>
In this case, <code>nix run</code> ran on my machine because I happened to have the libraries in the "right place" for a self contained dotnet core executable, but Gregg did not.
</p>

<p>
Neither, it turns out, did the docker container I was building. I built and tested it initially with a dotnet console app (which did work, not needing <code>libssl</code>) and then carried on assuming that running <code>nix run</code> on my local machine would also tell me if the docker image could run correctly.
</p>

<p>
I've now fixed up the code in the previous posts (we needed to add some <code>runtimeDeps</code> to our server package, and the docker image start up command needs to create a writable <code>/tmp</code> directory for asp.net to run correctly).
</p>

<p>
Most importantly though, I've also made sure that CI will prevent this from happening again by actually checking that the docker image produced can respond to a request to the index with a 200 response code. This is done by adding "stages" to our CI build; the first does exactly what we were doing already, the second then starts the just finished docker image as a "service" and uses <code>curl</code> to check it can respond to us.
