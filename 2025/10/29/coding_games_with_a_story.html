A short post this time, but one that will probably lead to more content here.
</p>

<p>
I'm teaming up with the long established and trusted <a href="https://www.thinkersmeetup.com/">Thinkers Meetup</a> to offer a course for 9-13 year old thinkers to write visual novels called <a href="https://www.thinkersmeetup.com/service-page/coding-games-with-a-story-ages-9-13">Coding Games with a Story</a>. I'm hoping this will be the first of many!
</p>

<p>
If you know people in that age range who would in interested, or you're wondering what on earth I'm talking about, this video might help!

For those of you who have been following along for a while, you might be more interested to hear that the course is being powered by an open source website written in F#, including some code that might look very familiar from my previous "dev journals" a year or two back. If you're interested in having a look at what a full (if not huge) F# project looks like, with realistically unpolished code, the repository is at <a href="https://github.com/mavnn/VisualInk">https://github.com/mavnn/VisualInk</a>.
