<p>I was looking to express a concept recently and realised I didn&#39;t have the terminology for it, so I decided to coin something.</p> <p>So I now have a new category if friendship:</p> <p>A &#39;real&#39; friend is someone who I can express an opinion to, disagree with and still be friends with.</p> <p>This is mostly independent of whether they are also a &#39;good&#39; friend (someone with whom there is a lot of shared knowledge and time) or a &#39;true&#39; friend (stuck with the friendship through crap, or at least given me strong reason to believe they would even if they haven&#39;t had to yet).</p> <p>Of course being in any of the categories makes moving into the others more likely...</p>
