<p>Possibly my geekiest self Birthday present ever: the #NOOO! manifesto (<a href="http://notonlyoo.org">http://notonlyoo.org</a>) t-shirt, personalized with membership number (and a !).</p> <p>I&#39;m not exactly a fashion model, but I was asked for pictures, so there you go. My wife also appears to have decided I needed to be backlit for the St. Lambda effect...</p> <p>Given the nature of the manifesto (&#39;Options over nulls&#39;) I was especially amused to see note the fact that whatever software they&#39;re using for the packing skips handles blank lines incorrectly and print &#39;null&#39; instead. Check the back text confirmation in the third picture.</p> <p><img src="/images/IMAG0232-1.jpg" alt="St. Lambda and the T-shirt of Extra Geek" /></p>
