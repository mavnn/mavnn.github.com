    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Your windows service is watching an email inbox.</p>

<p>How often should it poll?</p>

<p>Once every 5 minutes? Every 10? Then of course you realise that it should be different for every customer… or maybe every mailbox. You need more config!</p>

<h3>Or not.</h3>

<p>The real answer, of course, is something completely different: it should poll a lot when a lot of emails are arriving, and not very much when they aren’t.</p>

<p>It took a lot longer than it should have done to get my maths brain back on, but with the help of my wife I eventually settled on this code for deciding the intervals between polls:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><code class="fsharp"><span class="k">let</span> <span class="n">interval</span> <span class="n">i</span> <span class="o">=</span>
    <span class="k">let</span> <span class="n">x</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="kt">float</span> <span class="n">i</span>
    <span class="k">let</span> <span class="n">maxWait</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="mi">60</span><span class="o">.</span> <span class="o">*</span> <span class="mi">10</span><span class="o">.</span>
    <span class="k">let</span> <span class="n">raisePower</span> <span class="n">x</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="n">pown</span> <span class="o">(</span><span class="n">x</span> <span class="o">/</span><span class="mi">10</span><span class="o">.)</span> <span class="mi">4</span>
    <span class="o">(</span><span class="n">maxWait</span> <span class="o">*</span> <span class="o">(</span><span class="n">raisePower</span> <span class="n">x</span><span class="o">))</span> <span class="o">/</span> <span class="o">(</span><span class="n">raisePower</span> <span class="n">x</span> <span class="o">+</span> <span class="mi">1</span><span class="o">.)</span>
    <span class="o">|&gt;</span> <span class="o">(*)</span> <span class="mi">1000</span><span class="o">.</span> <span class="o">|&gt;</span> <span class="kt">int</span>
</code></pre></div>
<p>The ‘i’ in this function is the number of times we’ve polled since the last time a new email was received (if one is received, we reset i to 0).</p>

<p>If you plot this out on a graph, you get something that looks like this:</p>

<p><img src="http://www.wolframalpha.com/share/img?i=d41d8cd98f00b204e9800998ecf8427ehd954rh40i&amp;f=HBQTQYZYGY4TOM3CGRSGMMBWGAYDCM3DGYZGMOBWGFRDANDCMUZAaaaa" alt="" /></p>

<p>You can play with the shape of the graph at <a href="http://www.wolframalpha.com/share/clip?f=d41d8cd98f00b204e9800998ecf8427ehd954rh40i">Wolfram|Alpha if you&#39;re feeling really geeky</a> :).</p>

<p>This gives us very aggressive polling for the first few minutes after discovering an email, then dropping off rapidly to close to the one every ten minutes mark that I decided was a reasonable background polling rate.</p>

<p>It&#39;s not truly adaptive in the machine learning sense, but it gives a very good first cut that is an awful lot better than any fixed value could be.</p>
