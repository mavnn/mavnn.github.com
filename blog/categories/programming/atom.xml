    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Recently as part of some research into making a large (very large) solution build more efficient, I started looking into whether there&rsquo;s anyway of getting MsBuild to do
some of the donkey work for you. This is especially important in situations where you want to know what&rsquo;s doing used/produced with this particular set of parameters.</p>

<p>Obviously dealing with every possible custom build target is out of scope, but you can get a surprisingly long way be taking advantage of some of the intermediate build
targets used within the MsBuild Common targets files (imported into every *proj file created by Visual Studio).</p>

<p>Create yourself a little file called something like <code>Analyse.proj</code>, and put the following in it:</p>

<p>``` xml
&lt;?xml version=&ldquo;1.0&rdquo; encoding=&ldquo;utf-8&rdquo;?>
<Project ToolsVersion="12.0" DefaultTargets="WriteStuff" xmlns="http://schemas.microsoft.com/developer/msbuild/2003">
  <Import Project="$(TargetProject)"/>
  <Target Name="WriteStuff" DependsOnTargets="ResolveReferences"></p>

<pre><code>&lt;Message Importance="high" Text="References::@(ReferencePath)"/&gt;
&lt;Message Importance="high" Text="Compiles::@(BeforeCompile);@(Compile);@(AfterCompile)"/&gt;
&lt;Message Importance="high" Text="Output::$(OutputPath)"/&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>  </Target>
</Project>
```</p>

<p>This is a mini-MsBuild project that imports an other project &ndash; the project you want to analyse. You can &ldquo;build&rdquo; this project like so:</p>

<p>```
PS C:\DirectoryWithProj> &amp; &lsquo;C:\Program Files (x86)\MSBuild\12.0\Bin\SBuild&rsquo; .\Analyse.proj /nologo /p:TargetProject=./Fake.Shake.fsproj

```</p>

<p>And as you can see, whilst it&rsquo;s a bit ugly it generates a whole load of useful information for you about how <em>this</em> build with <em>these</em> properties will be built.</p>

<p>That&rsquo;s all for now!</p>

    <id>http://blog.mavnn.co.uk/sdd-conf-2015</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>So, nearly a month back now I had the fantastic opportunity to speak at this year&rsquo;s
<a href="http://sddconf.com/">Software, Design &amp; Development</a> at the Barbican on property based
testing &ndash; or more specifically, FsCheck.</p>

<!-- more -->


<p>It was a fun experience and a very different type of conference to the smaller, generally
open source community based events that I normally attend. There were a wide variety of
expert speakers, covering the whole range from people like myself presenting on potentially
useful but relatively unknown technology (in the enterprise world, at least &ndash;
property based testing is pretty well known in functional programming circles) through to
known industry names.</p>

<p>I won&rsquo;t go into the details of all the talks I attended as I was there for 3 days. But there
were a lot of good ideas on display ranging through sane naming (always worth watching
anything by <a href="https://twitter.com/KevlinHenney">Kevlin Henney</a> if you get a chance) to
project design (as opposed to project planning, probably more thoughts on that later) to
practical DDD examples in .net to the &ldquo;Zen of Architecture&rdquo;.</p>

<p>As a thank you
to <a href="https://twitter.com/kurt2001">Kurt Schelfthout</a> who wrote FsCheck, to spread further what
I think is an awesome concept and to give an idea
of some of the kind of things we do at <a href="http://www.15below.com/">15below</a> to any interested
developers I managed to arrange for the recording of my talk to be released publicly. It&rsquo;s
an unmanned camera, so you have a pretty good view of the slides with out having to see my
face at any point, which many people will see as an advantage! I strongly recommend full
screen viewing; there&rsquo;s a fair amount of code in the presentation.</p>

<iframe src="https://player.vimeo.com/video/129109178" width="100%" height="400" frameborder="0" webkitallowfullscreen mozallowfullscreen allowfullscreen></iframe>


<p>If you want to play with the code from the demo yourself, it&rsquo;s available <a href="https://github.com/mavnn/SddConf2015">on Github</a>. The slides are also available <a href="http://sddconf.com/brands/sdd/library/Breaking_Your_Code_In_New_Exciting_Ways.pdf">as a PDF</a>.</p>

    <link href="http://blog.mavnn.co.uk/serialization-in-net/"/>
    <updated>2015-05-21T16:11:28+01:00</updated>
    <id>http://blog.mavnn.co.uk/serialization-in-net</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Leaving the confines of your own process&rsquo;s safe little memory space is always a potentially painful moment
when you&rsquo;re coding up an up. Whether it&rsquo;s receiving data from the outside world, passing a message over
RabbitMQ to an other in house service, or writing an audit trail that needs to be accessible for the next
20 years, there&rsquo;s a bunch of considerations that need to be taken into account when you hit the joys of
serialization and deserialization.</p>

<!-- more -->


<h2>Mirror, mirror on the wall</h2>

<p>First up on the list is whether or not to use reflection. For those of you who aren&rsquo;t aware, reflection
is a way of inspecting the properties of your .net code at runtime, and various serialization libraries
take advantage of this to try and make your life easier.</p>

<p>The best known example of this is <a href="http://www.newtonsoft.com/json">Json.NET</a> &ndash; which will take any .net
object and try and create a Json representation of it &ndash; or vice versa.</p>

<p>``` csharp
Product product = new Product();
product.Name = &ldquo;Apple&rdquo;;
product.Expiry = new DateTime(2008, 12, 28);
product.Sizes = new string[] { &ldquo;Small&rdquo; };</p>

<p>string json = JsonConvert.SerializeObject(product);
// {
//   &ldquo;Name&rdquo;: &ldquo;Apple&rdquo;,
//   &ldquo;Expiry&rdquo;: &ldquo;2008-12-28T00:00:00&rdquo;,
//   &ldquo;Sizes&rdquo;: [
//     &ldquo;Small&rdquo;
//   ]
// }
```</p>

<p>This is a common technique, but it does have a few problems.</p>

<h3>Versioning</h3>

<p>The &ldquo;schema&rdquo; here is actually the underlying .net type that you are serializing &ndash; this can be great for
quick to implement communications between .net services which can share a &ldquo;messages&rdquo; dll with the type in.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, this also plays merry havoc in any scenario where your messages might persist
between versions of your messaging dll. Saving these objects to a document store for example, or trying to run two versions of a service at once (required for seamless deployment)
connected to a messaging bus.</p>

<p>Because .net will only allow you to have one version of an assembly loaded at once, you can&rsquo;t
easily build a way of deserializing the old format.</p>

<h3>Uglyness</h3>

<p>This might sound like a purely aesthetic consideration, and therefore beneath us
technical types but the result of automatic serialization is often ugly and strange
looking. And to be fair, it isn&rsquo;t normally a huge problem for as long as you&rsquo;re working
in a .net to .net scenario. But if, for example, you&rsquo;re writing an API to be consumed
from JavaScript your UI developers (which is probably still you, right?) will curse your
name forever more if you go this route. As well as this, as there&rsquo;s no schema, it&rsquo;s very
hard to tell in any other language whether the object you&rsquo;ve created will make it through
the deserialization process when it hits .net land again.</p>

<h3>Runtime failure</h3>

<p>That <code>JsonConvert.SerializeObject</code> method up there: it&rsquo;s generic. Which means it will
take any .net object you want to throw at it.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, the number of .net objects it can actually serialize is quite a bit more
restricted than &ldquo;any .net object you want to throw at it&rdquo;. And it has no way of telling
you that until run time, when it will just throw an exception, which can be pretty painful.</p>

<h3>When to use?</h3>

<p>Only use reflection based serialization in situations where you know the serialized
representation will be transient, and where you can test your serialization works at
runtime in advance. Additional, be very suspicious of using reflection based serialization
in any scenario where anything outside the .net ecosystem will need to access the data.</p>

<p>Typical scenarios:</p>

<ul>
<li>Caching</li>
<li>Inter-process communication in distributed systems</li>
<li>Message bus communications (only if you can guarantee the messages are transient)</li>
</ul>


<p>Avoid for:</p>

<ul>
<li>Permanent persistence</li>
<li>Defining APIs to be used from outside .net</li>
</ul>


<h3>Recommended implementation</h3>

<p>If you are doing reflection based serialization in .net, you want to use
<a href="https://nessos.github.io/FsPickler/">FsPickler</a>. It covers binary, json, bson and xml
serialization in a single library, is faster than Json.NET and successfully serializes
more types than Json.NET. What&rsquo;s not to like?</p>

<h2>Attribute all the things!</h2>

<p>As well as just trying to guess how to serialize things with reflection in .net,
there is also the <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/system.serializableattribute%28v=vs.110%29.aspx">Serializable</a> attribute that allows you to then serialize to a variety
of formats using the <code>System.Runtime.Serialization</code> name space. This a few advantages
over the raw reflection technique in theory (you can mark specific fields not to be serialized, for example) but to be blunt if you&rsquo;re going to go to this amount of effort you may
as well go for one of the safer options below.</p>

<h3>When to use?</h3>

<p>When you&rsquo;re using a Microsoft library that requires you to.</p>

<h2>Safety with (type) class</h2>

<p>If you happen to be working in F#, then <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/dd233203.aspx">member constraints</a> allow you to try a more flexible and type safe way of expressing
serialization &ndash; in exchange for a little more work.</p>

<p>As an example, the Chiron library allows you to do things like this:</p>

<p>``` fsharp
open Chiron
open Chiron.Operators</p>

<p>type InnerRecord =</p>

<pre><code>{
    Start : System.DateTime
    Id : System.Guid
}
static member FromJson (_ : InnerRecord) =
    (fun s i -&gt; { Start = s; Id = i })
    &lt;!&gt; Json.read "startTime"
    &lt;*&gt; Json.read "identity"
static member ToJson innerRecord =
    Json.write "startTime" innerRecord.Start
    *&gt; Json.write "identity" innerRecord.Id
</code></pre>

<p>type OuterRecord =</p>

<pre><code>{
    Name : string
    Inner : InnerRecord
}
static member FromJson (_ : OuterRecord) =
    (fun n i -&gt; { Name = n; Inner = i })
    &lt;!&gt; Json.read "name"
    &lt;*&gt; Json.read "inner"
static member ToJson outerRecord =
    Json.write "name" outerRecord.Name
    *&gt; Json.write "inner" outerRecord.Inner
</code></pre>

<p>{
  Name = &ldquo;my object&rdquo;
  Inner = {</p>

<pre><code>        Start = System.DateTime(2015, 5, 21)
        Id = System.Guid.NewGuid()
      }
</code></pre>

<p>}
|> Json.serialize
|> Json.format
// Your json goes here
```</p>

<p>A few interesting things to note here. Firstly, as you&rsquo;ve probably guessed, the magic
of telling Chiron how to serialize and deserialize things happens in the <code>ToJson</code> and
<code>FromJson</code> methods. What might not be so obvious is that if these methods are not
implemented with the correct signature, than <code>Json.serialize</code> will not compile when
fed the erroneous object. Which does wonders for eliminating run time errors!</p>

<p>Also, if you look carefully at the To and From methods you&rsquo;ll see that there&rsquo;s no need
for the fields in the Json and the .net object to have the same name. In fact, you can
apply what ever logic you want within them, allowing you to match a specific schema,
allow for different versions of the serialized data to be deserialized or just generally
make the serialized version prettier to use from other places.</p>

<p>You do, of course, have to actually write the From and To methods, which is definitely
more work. Having said that, it&rsquo;s not quite as bad as it sounds though: as you can see
from the <code>OuterRecord</code> type with it&rsquo;s <code>InnerRecord</code> field, and can nest the To and
From methods nicely &ndash; and the type system will check that your object is serializable
all the way down. Nice.</p>

<h3>When to use?</h3>

<p>Any time when you might have to persist data between versions, or process data during
the serialization/deserialization process &ndash; and you can specify your data types in F#.</p>

<h3>Recommended implementation</h3>

<p><a href="https://github.com/mausch/Fleece">Fleece</a> and <a href="https://github.com/xyncro/chiron/">Chiron</a>
both implement these techniques. Fleece is a more established library that has been tested
for longer, but I have had some performance issues with it in libraries with a lot of types
that implement To and From methods. Chiron is a little bit&hellip; cutting edge in age, but
has always been fast and reliable for me so far.</p>

<p>We currently use Fleece in one of our projects, and have provided some support to improving
the testing of Chiron as it looks like a hopeful alternative.</p>

<p>Edit: Eirik points out in the comments that FsPickler (mentioned above) also has a mechanism
for defining type safe (de)serialization <a href="http://nessos.github.io/FsPickler/tutorial.html#Picklers-and-Pickler-combinators">using Picklers</a>. I couldn&rsquo;t possibly guess where the library
got it&rsquo;s name.</p>

<h2>All the rest</h2>

<p>I&rsquo;m sure that there are other ways of tackling these problems &ndash; for example, for our
customer facing &ldquo;business&rdquo; APIs we&rsquo;re moving to specifying our API using hand crafted
XSD and WSDL files and then autogenerating code behind. This assumes, of course, you
have some reason to be using SOAP. But if you do, it works an awful lot better than
trying to autogenerate the schema from the code &ndash; a path that&rsquo;s lead me to worlds of
pain both as the consumer and producer of the schemas.</p>

<p>But the routes above are the most common paths that I&rsquo;ve come across as a .net developer
and I&rsquo;ve often discovered them being used in the &ldquo;wrong&rdquo; places. Retroactively having to
version reflection based APIs is a particular pain point that I&rsquo;d recommend avoiding if
you possibly can!</p>

    <link href="http://blog.mavnn.co.uk/api-design-workshop/"/>
    <updated>2015-05-07T15:35:51+01:00</updated>
    <id>http://blog.mavnn.co.uk/api-design-workshop</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Designing an API is hard.</p>

<p>You want to actually apply the
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Principle_of_least_astonishment">principle of least astonishment</a> &ndash;
but you&rsquo;re the person who wrote the code. You&rsquo;re unlikely to be astonished. So
you&rsquo;re trying to think how someone who didn&rsquo;t know what you know would think &ndash;
which is never an easy starting point!</p>

<p>Similarly, you&rsquo;re trying to create the
<a href="http://blog.codinghorror.com/falling-into-the-pit-of-success/">pit of success</a>
for users. Which means trying to make it <em>very hard</em> to do the wrong thing with
your API. Preferably, in strongly typed languages, this should include using the
type system to
<a href="http://fsharpforfunandprofit.com/posts/designing-with-types-making-illegal-states-unrepresentable/">make illegal states unrepresentable</a>
so that code that compiles is very likely to work.</p>

<p>In general, the core libraries for .net are not bad at API design, but there are
a few places where this isn&rsquo;t true. As an exercise, we at
<a href="http://www.15below.com/">15below</a> are going to take one of them, split into
teams and spend an hour or so seeing what alternatives we can come up with. Feel
free to follow along at home, and if you do give it a try ping me a code snippet
and I&rsquo;ll post it up with our internal attempts in a week or so.</p>

<!-- more -->


<h2>The API</h2>

<p>Lots of things can be represented as streams of data. Files, network
connections, compressed archives, chunks of memory&hellip; the list goes on.</p>

<p>So .net provides us with the <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/system.io.stream%28v=vs.110%29.aspx?f=255&amp;MSPPError=-2147217396"><code>System.IO.Stream</code> class</a>.</p>

<p>Which is great and all&hellip; except that not all streams are equal. For example,
your function might need write access to a stream, and not all streams are
writable. You can check easily enough, but the only way of flagging to the user
you need write access is via comments or naming conventions. The same is true
for requiring the ability to read from the stream or seek to specific locations
with in it.</p>

<h2>The challenge</h2>

<p>Have a look through the interface provided by <code>System.IO.Stream</code>. Create a
skeleton of an API that could implement the same functionality, be reasonably
easy to use and tries to make illegal states unrepresentable as much as
possible. Note: this API does <em>not</em> have to be functional.</p>

<p>Try adding a few example methods that make use of your API (hint: your design
will probably be better if you write these first).</p>

<p>Maybe you want to try using interfaces and
<a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/3663739/method-parameter-with-multiple-interface-restrictions">multiple interface constraints</a>. Or
you have some clever idea for representing things with
<a href="http://fsharpforfunandprofit.com/posts/discriminated-unions/">discriminated unions</a>. Or
maybe you just know that there&rsquo;s a better core library out there with a nicer
representation you can rip off whole sale! Who knows?</p>

<p>Post your work up somewhere it can be seen on the internet and ping me a link,
and we&rsquo;ll go over the submissions and write up a commentary over the next week
or two.</p>
