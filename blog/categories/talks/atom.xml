    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Yesterday was the <a href="https://skillsmatter.com/conferences/7036-functional-programming-exchange-2015#skillscasts">Functional Programming Exchange 2015</a> and this being SkillsMatter,
the videos are already up. It&rsquo;s a great place to talk from that point of view, with consistently excellent organisation.</p>

<p>I was talking on being a &ldquo;Functional Programmer in an Imperative World&rdquo;; the slides are embedded below, but for the full experience check out the video at the link above.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>So, nearly a month back now I had the fantastic opportunity to speak at this year&rsquo;s
<a href="http://sddconf.com/">Software, Design &amp; Development</a> at the Barbican on property based
testing &ndash; or more specifically, FsCheck.</p>

<!-- more -->


<p>It was a fun experience and a very different type of conference to the smaller, generally
open source community based events that I normally attend. There were a wide variety of
expert speakers, covering the whole range from people like myself presenting on potentially
useful but relatively unknown technology (in the enterprise world, at least &ndash;
property based testing is pretty well known in functional programming circles) through to
known industry names.</p>

<p>I won&rsquo;t go into the details of all the talks I attended as I was there for 3 days. But there
were a lot of good ideas on display ranging through sane naming (always worth watching
anything by <a href="https://twitter.com/KevlinHenney">Kevlin Henney</a> if you get a chance) to
project design (as opposed to project planning, probably more thoughts on that later) to
practical DDD examples in .net to the &ldquo;Zen of Architecture&rdquo;.</p>

<p>As a thank you
to <a href="https://twitter.com/kurt2001">Kurt Schelfthout</a> who wrote FsCheck, to spread further what
I think is an awesome concept and to give an idea
of some of the kind of things we do at <a href="http://www.15below.com/">15below</a> to any interested
developers I managed to arrange for the recording of my talk to be released publicly. It&rsquo;s
an unmanned camera, so you have a pretty good view of the slides with out having to see my
face at any point, which many people will see as an advantage! I strongly recommend full
screen viewing; there&rsquo;s a fair amount of code in the presentation.</p>

<p>If you want to play with the code from the demo yourself, it&rsquo;s available <a href="https://github.com/mavnn/SddConf2015">on Github</a>. The slides are also available <a href="http://sddconf.com/brands/sdd/library/Breaking_Your_Code_In_New_Exciting_Ways.pdf">as a PDF</a>.</p>

<p>Many thanks to the conference organisers <a href="http://www.yellowstonetechmedia.com/">Yellowstone TechMedia</a>, and I&rsquo;ll definitely be considering submitting talks/attending again next year.</p>
