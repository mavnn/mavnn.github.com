    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Last week was the annual <a href="https://skillsmatter.com/conferences/8268-progressive-dot-net-2017">Progressive .Net</a> conference, hosted at <a href="https://skillsmatter.com">SkillsMatter</a>.</p>

<p>It was a bit of a strange conference for me; I was invited to speak, and very much enjoyed meeting up with everyone but I also had a bunch of other work I needed to get done. That means that unlike some other conferences I won&#39;t be able to give much speaker feedback!</p>

<p>However, there were a few sessions I managed to pay some attention to and some thoughts about my own that I&#39;d like to record - so here goes!</p>

<h2><a href="https://skillsmatter.com/skillscasts/10458-pilot-decision-management#video">Pilot Decision Making for Beginners</a></h2>

<p><a href="https://twitter.com/CliffordAgius">Clifford Agnius</a> is an airline pilot and .net developer who gave a really nice talk on how to make decisions - whether you need to make them <strong>right now</strong> (hint: practice in advance) or whether you need to decide on a plan.</p>

<p>It was tempting to just nod along and go &quot;oh, that&#39;s just common sense&quot; - until it strikes you that codified, pre-agreed common sense is pretty spectacularly valuable.</p>

<h2><a href="https://skillsmatter.com/skillscasts/10670-have-i-got-dot-net-for-you">Have I got .NET for You</a></h2>

<p>&quot;Have I got .NET for You&quot; was fun, and <a href="https://twitter.com/dylanbeattie">Dylan Beattie</a> is a very silly boy.</p>

<h2>A Practical Introduction to Functional Programming with F#</h2>

<p>This was me; no video I&#39;m afraid, as it was a 3 hour practical session.</p>

<p>I was really pleased by the turn out for this - I&#39;m guessing there were 30-40 people there (anyone who actually counted, feel free to correct me!).</p>

<p><img src="/images/crowd_view.jpg" alt="View of the room filling up"></p>

<p>I had to make a rather quick swerve in the presentation of the topic right at the beginning, as I had been expecting a group most of whom had tried F# and wanted to learn more about functional programming - while I actually got a group where only 3 people had even looked at F# who wanted to learn about functional programming!</p>

<p>After walking people through the first couple of exercises to get the basic syntax down, people seemed to be off and flying (SkillsMatter has a good coffee supply):</p>

<p>Mind being blown is a good thing, right?</p>

<p>All in all, much fun was had by all (I think).</p>

<h2>The Web that Never Was</h2>

<p>Dylan&#39;s final key note was a alternative history of the web, a combination of (real) good ideas that were dropped due to the vagaries of history and application of 20-20 hindsight.</p>

<p>Apart from being entertaining, it was also thought provoking for anyone designing software today.</p>

<p>Also: Dylan is still a very silly boy.</p>

<p>At time of writing the recording of this hadn&#39;t been published, but I suspect it will appear shortly.</p>

<h2>Wrap!</h2>

<p>All in all, I very much enjoyed ProgNet and I&#39;m hoping to be involved again next year - apart from the sessions there was also plentiful coffee, chats, and opportunities to catch up with interesting people.</p>

    <id>https://blog.mavnn.co.uk/return-to-the-ivory-tower-video</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>As mentioned on the blog already, I had the opportunity to talk at this year&#39;s F# Exchange at <a href="https://skillsmatter.com/">skillsmatter</a>. As always, they&#39;ve done an excellent job on the video production, so if you&#39;re interested in what makes F# different from other programming languages have a watch of <a href="https://skillsmatter.com/skillscasts/9883-fixing-real-life-problems-from-the-ivory-tower">Fixing Real Life Problems From the Ivory Tower</a> (free log in required).</p>

<p>If you like the talk and would like to learn more, these are also the subjects that I&#39;ll be covering in my recently announced <a href="/level-up-your-f-number-skills/">Level Up Your F#</a> course, which will be running for 2 days in London on the 15th-16th June.</p>

    <id>https://blog.mavnn.co.uk/video-and-slides-for-from-the-ivory-tower</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I spoke this morning at <a href="https://skillsmatter.com/conferences/7145-f-exchange-2016#program">F# Exchange</a> and this being SkillsMatter they&#39;ve published the recording already.</p>

<p>It&#39;s a nice short talk, weighing in at about 15 minutes. So grab yourself a coffee and
take a short tour of how some of F#&#39;s more esoteric features (active patterns, computational expressions,
quotations and type providers) have been used to solve real problems in the real world.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I recently gave a live streamed tutorial on building type providers, which I&#39;ve embedded below. Apologies for the sound; apparently Google Hangouts added a feature I was unaware of until after the stream started which mutes your microphone whenever you type.</p>

<p>Fortunately I think enough was preserved to be useful, and (amazingly!) all of the demonstrations actually worked.</p>

<iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/pXT0li6zxKQ" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe>

<p>If you&#39;d like to try things out for yourself, there&#39;s a github repository at https://github.com/mavnn/CambridgeTypeProvider which contains 6 individual fsx files, one for each new feature added to the type provider.</p>

<p>There&#39;s a bunch of other type provider information scattered around this blog, if you&#39;re interested just click <a href="https//blog.mavnn.co.uk/blog/categories/typeprovider/">the &quot;typeprovider&quot; tag</a>.</p>

the videos are already up. It&#39;s a great place to talk from that point of view, with consistently excellent organisation.</p>

<p>I was talking on being a &quot;Functional Programmer in an Imperative World&quot;; the slides are embedded below, but for the full experience check out the video at the link above.</p>
