  <div class="entry-content"><div>About 2 weeks ago, our unborn child died. We found out on Thursday (20/12/2012).</div>
<p />
<div>I&#8217;ve written this as a blog post: I&#8217;m not sure why, as I&#8217;m not sure that I&#8217;ll ever publish it. But if I do, and you&#8217;re normally here to read the technobabble, and you don&#8217;t care about the emotional stuff, the sentence above is probably all you need to know. One of the reasons this might get published is that I really don&#8217;t want to have to tell everyone about it in person.</div>
<p />
<div>As of Thursday morning, all seemed to be going well with the pregnancy. &nbsp;That morning was the primary school play; the afternoon was the midwife &#8216;just in case&#8217; check.</div>
<p />
<div>Roll back one: there is a medical history here that meant this was considered a high risk pregnancy. Hence the regular checks. &nbsp;</div>
<p />
<div>School finished at lunch for the last day before the Christmas break, and we were out of the &#8216;danger zone&#8217; first 12 weeks, so older brother went along with Mamma to hear the heart beat. There wasn&#8217;t one. I&#8217;m working from home, and it&#8217;s nearly dinner time, so we grab some food and all 3 of us go to the hospital. There&#8217;s no one who can provide child care on such short notice even if we want it, and there is absolutely zero chance I&#8217;m sending my wife on her own.</div>
<p />
<div>Roll back two: we already knew that at this point (~15 weeks into the pregnancy) it&#8217;s not always possible to hear the heart beat with the equipment available to the midwife. But she had managed to hear the heartbeat 2 weeks earlier. So I&#8217;m worried, but still hoping that this is hassle rather than something actually having gone wrong.</div>
<p />
<div>Aside: Maternity triage is a strange place, directly attached to the maternity ward. So you sit and wait (not a massive amount of time in the grand scheme of things) watching the really heavily pregnant people right at the end of the process go past. This is a strange, and not especially comforting experience. For bonus points I suspect a lot of the people who&#8217;s pregnancies have gone smoothly don&#8217;t even know what the triage area is. You get some strange looks sitting there with someone who obviously isn&#8217;t ready to give birth; as if as a man you need the reason to be there of someone giving birth or else you&#8217;re some kind of weird alien invader into the space.</div>
<p />
<div>The doctor who saw us was thorough, sympathetic and direct. It&#8217;s pretty obvious from the ultra sound that things are not good; even as a layman I&#8217;ve seen enough scans that it&#8217;s immediately apparent the baby isn&#8217;t alive. The only thing the doctor can add is that it isn&#8217;t recent; there are signs that I wouldn&#8217;t have spotted that the baby had been dead for some time.</div>
<p />
<div>&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;</div>
<p />
<div>We spent Friday in hospital dealing with the medical side of the process which was harrowing but complete. My wife&#8217;s physical health is fine apart from tiredness and soreness that seem to be steadily returning to normal. My family and my work were both fantastic: I work in the same office as my brother at the moment, and they had no problem with both of us just disappearing. He stayed with our son (along with my parents and niece for a good chunk of the day) while we were at hospital. I&#8217;m amazingly grateful for the flexibility and availability of people: it was brought home to me even further when my Dad at one point, as an aside, checked if I&#8217;d been able to get time off to be at the hospital and I realised that when my parents went through a very similar experience in the 70s that probably was not a given.</div>
<p />
<div>So&#8230; physically that&#8217;s it. Done. Of course, in reality, it&#8217;s not that simple. &nbsp;When my grandfather passed away, I learnt something pretty important about myself, that has stayed with me ever since: I can freely mix joy and sorrow in life in ways that most people seem to find hard, or even distasteful. I&#8217;m not sure if this is a gift, or a minor insanity, but it&#8217;s definitely very helpful as life doesn&#8217;t tend to come in nice discriminated good and bad packages. So here I am, in mourning while celebrating advent. Frequently in tears (lesson number 2 from grandfather passing away: I realised I needed to learn to cry. It took a long time to learn), yet genuinely looking forward to going to the candle lit carols with the family. Feeling the heart ache of this person I&#8217;ll never know while checking out my son&#8217;s Christmas present that just arrived in the post. &nbsp;Wondering how I&#8217;m ever going to put this stuff into words, whilst making fun of myself across the internet as I try to drink my espresso with salt instead of sugar (by mistake, obviously&#8230;). &nbsp;And it&#8217;s hard, because it&#8217;s all real; but it doesn&#8217;t feel it. In the same way that when you find out that there&#8217;s a child on the way, there&#8217;s always a bit of a feel of unreality to it (you don&#8217;t know what they&#8217;re going to be like, there&#8217;s no signs of the pregnancy yet, etc), when you find out that they&#8217;re not on the way that feels pretty unreal too. &nbsp;Except that it&#8217;s not: they&#8217;re really gone, and we really got to see them, and when the sadness comes it&#8217;s not unreal at all.</div>
<p />
<div>It&#8217;s a mix of bereavement and the opportunity not taken. The sadness of a missing loved one mixed with the &#8216;what if&#8217; of not pushing the open door. Because however much you know there&#8217;s nothing that you could have done, this is still someone you were the guardian of. Even if you couldn&#8217;t guard them yet: I don&#8217;t feel guilt, as if I should have saved them. But it does feel as if&#8230; something. &nbsp;As if there should have been an option I could have taken to protect them. I&#8217;m at peace that there wasn&#8217;t: but not that there shouldn&#8217;t have been. &nbsp;And there&#8217;s a whole medley of other things flying around as well: how awesome my immediate family have been, with my 5 year old doing everything he knows how to offer support and be as considerate as he knows how. My incredible wife, who somehow impossibly has managed to let herself start grieving without falling apart. My family who have stepped in and mostly just been available, and just done what we asked without trying to &#8216;save the day&#8217; or take over.</div>
<p />
<div>And a special shout out to the new church. They have been wonderful as a safe place, and a comfort and a source of peace. No one&#8217;s tried to fix it, or tell us it&#8217;s all ok. No one has tried to step in and be the hero. &nbsp;But they&#8217;ve been with us, and prayed with us. They dropped off flowers at the flat while we were still at the hospital. They took me off the rota I was due to be on for Sunday before I had to ask (I didn&#8217;t get the message in time so asked anyway, but hey ho!). &nbsp;They came and *actually spoke to us* about things. No prying, no pushing just the honest &#8220;how are you doing?&#8221; that actually expects an answer. With discretion, and care, but they made sure that as many people as possible who had known we were expecting knew the news without us having to go to everyone and tell them. And they came to both of us, not just my wife; just to make sure that I wasn&#8217;t being ignored just because I&#8217;m &#8216;the man&#8217;.</div>
<p />
<div>Two things in particular I&#8217;ll treasure for a long time out of all of this. One is my wife saying on the way to church that after the service she was going to seek out two particular ladies and ask them to pray with and support her: and at the end of the service the two of them being there before she had a chance to stand up. &nbsp;And the pastor, who had been ill in the morning and so hadn&#8217;t heard the news. We saw him before the evening carols, and he asked my wife how things were going. &nbsp;She told him, and with the service about to start, and about 400 people waiting for him he just stopped, grabbed us in a hug and cried (while praying for us). It was, I think, the single most therapeutic thing anyone has ever done for me.</div>
<p />
<div>So I cry, and smile. And I mean them both.</div>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Libraries like FsCheck ( <a href="http://fscheck.codeplex.com/">http://fscheck.codeplex.com/</a> ) and  Pex always capture my imagination as fantastically clever and potentially useful tools. Along with things like strong type systems and code contacts they especially appeal to my long buried mathematical background.</p> <p>Unfortunately, and probably because of said mathematical background, I sometimes struggle to think of ways to use them outside of maths and science problems. If I&#39;m working on a maths library or I decide I want to write a sorting algorithm, trivially easy sanity checks of things like whether a function is cummutative or associative are immediately useful.</p> <p>If I&#39;m writing a service that polls an email address for bounced emails and out of office replies&#8230; I don&#39;t know. It feels like there should be things they can help me with: after all, over the years I&#39;ve decided the strong type system is helpful even for this side of things, so surely the QuickCheck/proof side of things should be to. But the amount of work it requires to set up the test generators for complex data types (and then trying to formalize the acceptance criteria without just writing the actual implementation!) feels so large compared to the size of the project that I can never justify the time to actually use the tools.</p> <p>So I&#39;m left wondering: am I missing something? Is there a whole new level of treating ease and vigour I&#39;m missing out on just because I don&#39;t have the imagination and experience to make good use of the tools right there in front of me? </p> <p>Or are these tools only really useful in their own narrow field? </p> <p>I suspect the middle ground; for the moment ideas are avoiding me in droves. Any good open source examples out there of these tools in use for the kind of &#39;business&#39; code that most of us spend most of our time writing? </p>

Every time.</div><p /><div>A bit of trial of error discovered two things:</div><p /><div>The error went away if I referenced NuGet.Core 2.2.0 alpha 4<br /></div><p /><div>And the minimal error case is pretty minimal:</div><p /><div><script src="https://gist.github.com/4136322.js"></script></div><p /><div>Looking at the NuGet.Core source ( <a href="http://nuget.codeplex.com/SourceControl/changeset/view/5b6d7e16b19c#src%2fCore%2fSemanticVersion.cs">http://nuget.codeplex.com/SourceControl/changeset/view/5b6d7e16b19c#src%2fCore%2fSemanticVersion.cs</a> ) the only thing that might be a relevant change that I can see is a simplification of some custom GetHashCode logic.</div> <p /><div>Raising the interesting question of why there is custom GetHashCode logic in the first place, and how the heck did they get it to cause internal F# compiler errors anyway? And why did it only fail on that one specific version of Windows?</div> <p /><div>All very strange. Hopefully 2.2.0 will be a full release before we want to start using this technique for in our production code! </div>

  <div class="entry-content"><p><span style="color: #222222; font-family: arial, sans-serif;">EasyNetQ (</span><a href="https://github.com/mikehadlow/EasyNetQ" target="_blank" style="color: #1155cc; font-family: arial, sans-serif;">https://github.com/mikehadlow/EasyNetQ</a><span style="color: #222222; font-family: arial, sans-serif;">) is a simple wrapper for RabbitMq that allows you to trivially send and receive plain .net objects over the wire (as long as they can be serialized). It handles all the details of setting up exchanges and queues for you, and as long as your use case fits its (deliberately) simple pattern it&#8217;s very convenient.</span></p>
<div style="color: #222222; font-family: arial, sans-serif;">Unfortunately, if you want to use it in a more functional landscape (*cough* from F# *cough*), the fact that it exposes subscriptions via registering a callback is not the ideal interface. In these situations, it&#8217;s much easier to handle (and reason about) a lazy infinite sequence of messages that you can then handle however you want, including in the simplest case just sitting on the sequence in a small tail call recursive function.</div>
<div style="color: #222222; font-family: arial, sans-serif;">So EasyFQ was born. Weighing in at a mighty 16 lines of F# code, it contains one function: SeqSubscibe&lt;&#8217;a&gt; :&nbsp;(IBus -&gt; string -&gt; seq&lt;&#8217;a&gt;).</div>
<div style="color: #222222; font-family: arial, sans-serif;">There&#8217;s a .fsx with example usage in the GitHub repository:&nbsp;<a href="https://github.com/michael-newton-15below/EasyFQ" target="_blank" style="color: #1155cc;">https://github.com/michael-newton-15below/EasyFQ</a></div>
<div style="color: #222222; font-family: arial, sans-serif;">I suppose the next step is to pester Mike into making it a Nuget package under the EasyNetQ umbrella&#8230;</div>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>So, I have several people from technical/mathematical backgrounds who are interested in learning more about programming, specifically with .net in some cases.</p> <p>Tooling is easy; Visual Studio Express, Monodevelop and Sharp Develop are all freely available.</p> <p>The question is, where would you start people off in terms of learning good, solid (see what I did there?) coding practices? Give them small projects and critique? Are there good open source projects for starters to get involved with? </p> <p>Given the intelligence and background of these people, teaching them syntax is the least of my worries: a basic tutorial and Project Euler will have them writing code that works in no time. Most of them even have &#39;toy project&#39; level skills in other programming languages. It&#39;s helping them learn how to build projects that work without falling into all the classic pitfalls of spaghetti code, or at least helping them climb out as quickly as possible.</p> <p>The thing that springs to mind (given there is several people) is to find a real world project that could be split into several &#39;trivial&#39; pieces that would need to communicate with each other; immediate opportunities to teach things like messaging, modularization and IoC (especially with some not very strict TDD built in). After the tutorial/Project Euler stage above, obviously.</p> <p>Suggestions? Other ideas? </p>

  <div class="entry-content"><div>Having recently moved one of our (<a href="http://15below.com">http://15below.com</a>) infrastructure services from using MSMQs to RabbitMq (via using EasyNetQ: <a href="https://github.com/mikehadlow/EasyNetQ">https://github.com/mikehadlow/EasyNetQ</a>), I then wanted to run it through some simple stress tests. One of the reasons for this is that the old service used to time out on messages regularly, leaving them in a dead letter queue and requiring us to write the &#39;DeadLetterProcessor&#39; (a complete service in it&#39;s own right) to deal with the time outs.</div> <p /><div>74 lines of F# later, I was hitting the service with 40,000 requests spread across 4 parallel processes.</div><br /><div><script src="https://gist.github.com/3832369.js"></script></div> <p /><div>And the results: 18 seconds to process the lot, with no time outs or losses. Requests were going in faster than the service could process them, but Rabbit was admirably handling that side of things, and with the new setup multiple copies of the service would automatically round robin requests if that was ever needed.</div> <p /><div>Adious, DeadLetterProcessor: it was nice deleting you&#8230;</div>
