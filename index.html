<p>Lots of people these days seem to like giving Halloween sales, but historically and theologically, Halloween is really just the precursor to the real celebration: <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/All_Saints%27_Day">All Saints&#39; Day</a>.</p>

<p>So in the interest of getting the details right, we&#39;re having an All Saints&#39; Day sale, starting today for 7 days. It&#39;s already live, get your 10% off <a href="/building-solid-systems-in-f-number/">your tickets</a> now.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I&#39;m very pleased to announce the release of an initial alpha of <a href="https://github.com/RouteMasterIntegration/RouteMaster">RouteMaster</a>.</p>

<p>What is it? Well, I&#39;ll let the README speak for itself:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>RouteMaster is a .NET library for writing stateful workflows on top of a message bus. It exists to make the implementation of long running business processes easy in event driven systems.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>There is also example code in the repository so you can see what things are starting to look like.</p>

<p>For those of you following along, this will sound awfully familiar; that&#39;s because RouteMaster is the outcome of my decision to rebuild a <a href="/process-management-in-easynetq/">Process Manager</a> for EasyNetQ. The first cut of that was imaginatively called &quot;EasyNetQ.ProcessManager&quot;, but I decided to rename it for three main reasons:</p>

<ul>
<li>On re-reading <a href="http://www.enterpriseintegrationpatterns.com/">Enterprise Integration Patterns</a>, it occurred to me that RouteMaster was an enabler for many of the other patterns as well as the &quot;Process Manager&quot;</li>
<li>The message bus RouteMaster uses is provided as an interface; the main dll has no dependency on EasyNetQ at all</li>
<li>The previous EasyNetQ.ProcessManager is still available as a Nuget package supplied by my previous employer, and they have both the moral and legal rights to the package given I wrote the original on their time</li>
</ul>

<p>A pre-emptive few FAQs:</p>

<h3>Is this ready to use?</h3>

<p>No, not yet. I&#39;m out of time I can afford to spend on it right now, get in touch if you can/want to fund future development.</p>

<p>If you want to play, the code as provided does run and all of the process tests pass.</p>

<h3>Urgh! All the examples are F#!?</h3>

<p>Yes, but there is a C# friendly API in the works. See the first question :)</p>

<h3>What infrastructure do I need to run this?</h3>

<p>At the moment, I&#39;m using EasyNetQ (over RabbitMQ) and PostgreSQL (via Marten) for transport and storage respectively.</p>

<h3>What about things like NServiceBus and MassTransit?</h3>

<p>In some ways they fall in a similar space to RouteMaster, but with a different philosophy. Just as EasyNetQ is a focused library that supplies only part of the functionality you&#39;d find in these larger solutions, RouteMaster is designed to work with your chosen transport abstraction not replace it.</p>

<h2>Ask not what your RouteMaster can do for you, but what you can do for your RouteMaster!</h2>

<p>I&#39;d really like feedback, ideas, use cases and suggestions - leave comments here or ping an issue onto the repository. If you&#39;re feeling really brave and can try and actually experiment with it, but at the moment I&#39;m mostly hoping for concrete use cases and, well, funding.</p>

<p>Quite a few people over the years have hit my website searching for an EasyNetQ process manager, and others have asked me if it&#39;s still available. I&#39;d like to hear from as many of you as possible to build the tightest, simplest solution which will do the job.</p>

      <p class="meta">
        








  


<time datetime="2017-10-25T15:52:57+01:00" pubdate data-updated="true">Oct 25<span>th</span>, 2017</time>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I&#39;ve written about how nice Freya is as a library, but documentation is still a little light on the ground.</p>

<p>So here&#39;s a minimal implementation of a &quot;microservice&quot; Freya API, starting from which dotnet commands to run to install the Freya template, through to a running web service.</p>

<p>Make sure you have an up to date .NET Core SDK installed, and grab yourself the handy dandy Freya template:</p>

<figure class='code'><figcaption><span></span></figcaption><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class='bash'><span class='line'>dotnet new -i <span class="s2">&quot;Freya.Template::*&quot;</span>
</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>

<p>Then create yourself a directory and go into it. The following command will set up a brand new Freya project using kestrel as the underlying webserver, and Hopac (rather than F# Async) for concurrency. Alternatively, you can leave both the options off and you&#39;ll get Freya running on Suave with standard Async.</p>

<figure class='code'><figcaption><span></span></figcaption><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class='bash'><span class='line'>dotnet new freya --framework kestrel --concurrency hopac
</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>

<p>Your project should run at this point; <code>dotnet run</code> will spin up a webserver on port 5000 which will give a 404 at the root and text responses on /hello and /hello/name paths.</p>

<p>Api.fs is where all the magic of configuring Freya happens - KestrelInterop.fs contains boilerplate for making sure Routing information passes correctly between Kestrel and Freya, and Program.fs just starts Kestrel with our Freya API as an OWIN app.</p>

<h3>Adding JSON</h3>

<p>So, this is great and all, but we&#39;re building a microservice aren&#39;t we? That normally means JSON (or at least something more structured than plain text!).</p>

<p>Let&#39;s change things up so that as well as supplying the name to greet in the route, we can POST JSON with a name field to the /hello end point.</p>

<p>To respond in JSON, we need a Freya <code>Represent</code> record. We&#39;re sending a result with a fixed structure, so we don&#39;t need a serialization library or anything, we&#39;ll just construct the JSON by hand. Stick this near the top of Api.fs:</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p><img src="/images/WorkflowAlpha.png" alt="Log of workflow test running"></p>

<p><strong>It&#39;s alive!</strong> The process manager code I&#39;ve been reconstructing (see <a href="/process-management-in-easynetq/">Intro</a> and the <a href="/an-in-memory-message-bus-in-100-lines-or-less/">in memory test bus</a>) is slowly starting to take some shape.</p>

<p>As you can see, it comes with nice (<a href="https://github.com/logary/logary#using-logary-in-a-library">no dependency</a>) logging out of the box and it is async all the way down to the underlying transport.</p>

<p>This is still at the underlying plumbing phase in many ways: the code to construct a workflow like this is currently a boilerplate covered ugly mess - but it&#39;s all boilerplate which has been deliberately designed to allow powerful APIs to be built over the top.</p>

<p>Next up: a nice sleek API for creating &quot;pipeline&quot; workflows more easily. Then the real fun starts - pleasant to use abstractions over fork/join semantics&#8230;</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>As part of <a href="/building-solid-systems-in-f-number/">a two day training course</a> I&#39;m going to be putting together a bunch of material on how to run .NET Core code on kubernetes.</p>

<p>It will include things like:</p>

<ul>
<li>Setting up CI/automated builds</li>
<li>Configuring ingress points (including ssl via self updating Let&#39;s Encrypt certs)</li>
<li>Monitoring and metrics of the running system</li>
</ul>

<p>If you&#39;d have any interest in this material as a separate module (which wouldn&#39;t be F# specific), do get in touch. I&#39;d reckon it will become a one day course, either in house or hosted.</p>

<p>As an aside, once the material has been battle tested a few times, I will also be putting together a &quot;base&quot; deployment repository - although it will have fair warning that Kubernetes is really still the kind of thing that requires you to understand it before you start pushing things onto it, not just cutting and pasting someone else&#39;s config.</p>

<p>After all, you&#39;re the one who&#39;s going to get the phone call at 03:00&#8230;</p>

<p>It was a bit of a strange conference for me; I was invited to speak, and very much enjoyed meeting up with everyone but I also had a bunch of other work I needed to get done. That means that unlike some other conferences I won&#39;t be able to give much speaker feedback!</p>

      </p>
    
  </header>


  <div class="entry-content"><p>We are running another course, and I&#39;m officially stoked! Read on for the details&#8230;</p>

<h2>Building Solid Systems in F#</h2>

<p>Writing code is only the first part of putting software into production - to run, maintain and scale your product, you&#39;ll need to understand and design the overall system.</p>

<p>This 2 day course will take you through best practice in both writing an F# based, distributed system and running it in production - including sensible inter-operation with components written in other languages.</p>

<p>To fit this into 2 days, we&#39;ll need to make some opinionated decisions (such as using F#!), but many of the ideas and concepts will be transferable. </p>

<h2>We&#39;ll cover:</h2>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Writing reliable code using F#&#8217;s unique language features</li>
<li>Learn how to apply SOLID (like) principles in a functional style</li>
<li>How to instrument distributed services</li>
<li>Continuous Improvement: 
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Unit testing</li>
<li>Performance measurement</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Running distributed systems in development</li>
<li>Deploying distributed systems to production</li>
<li>Good practice in dependency management and code organization</li>
</ul>

<h2>You&#39;ll come away with:</h2>

<p>
A git repository of your completed work, which will include:
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Nicely instrumented, benchmarked and unit tested F# services</li>
<li>A scripted, deterministic deployment process for the overall distributed system</li>
<li>Real time centralized logging, metrics and health feedback from the system, whether running on the dev machine or in production</li>
<li>Zero down time continuous deployment for the overall system</li>
</ul>

<h2>Prerequisites:</h2>

<p>
You need to have:
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>a basic knowledge of F# syntax</li>
<li>a reasonable background knowledge of software development</li>
</ul>

<p>
You need to bring laptop with:
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>a relatively recent F# development environment (you&#8217;ll need to be able to build dotnet core 2.0 apps)</li>
<li>Minikube installed</li>
</ul>

<p>
We&#8217;ll also ask you to pre-download some code and containers in advance so that we can hit the ground running on the first day; we&#8217;ll pass you the details of that before the event. 
</p>

<h2>Is this a replacement for Level Up Your F#?</h2>

<p>No; <a href="https://blog.mavnn.co.uk/level-up-your-f-number-skills/">Level Up Your F#</a> focussed on the details of the F# language, this course is focussed on building systems. We will be running Level Up Your F# again in the future.</p>

<h2>Where will it happen?</h2>

<p>At the <a href="https://wellcomecollection.org/">Wellcome Collection</a></p>

<h2>Where can I get tickets?</h2>

<h2>What have other people said about your courses?</h2>

<p>Hassan Ezzahir, Lead developer (Contractor) at BNP Paribas</p>

<blockquote>
<p>I’ve been trying to learn F# for several years now and got almost all
the existing books on the subjects.</p>

<p>Yet, I felt there was a gap between my good understanding of the
language and actually applying it on bigger “real” projects.</p>

<p>Michael’s great training skills has enabled me to quickly practice some
advanced topics I was less familiar with.</p>

<p>With my newly acquired knowledge, I’m confident I will be able achieve
some great (and fun) developments with F#</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Alexander Battisti, Senior Software Developer (Machine Learning) at Freeletics GmbH</p>

<blockquote>
<p>I found &quot;Level Up your F#&quot; a good course teaching advanced topics in
F# that are commonly ignored or glossed over when you are on your own,
but are useful enough so you shouldn&#39;t ignore them. The exercises were
difficult in a good way and engaging. I definitely recommend the
course for anybody after they took their first serious steps in
learning F#.</p>

<p>TD;LR: <code>System.Console</code> (at least on dotnet core 2.0) is not as threadsafe as you&#39;d hope, and means that writing any simple cross platform console UI is nearly impossible.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>In reimplementing an <a href="/process-management-in-easynetq/">EasyNetQ process manager</a> one of the things I wanted to keep from the original project was an in memory message bus that could be used for testing without requiring a running RabbitMQ server. The code has ended up being pleasingly short and also uses a few techniques that seemed interesting, so I thought I&#39;d document it here as part of the design process.</p>

<p>Please note we&#39;re not going for a full re-implementation of RabbitMQ in memory here, but this does give us enough to do some useful testing!</p>

<li>If you&#39;re on a Mac, you&#39;ll need to update All The Things&trade; to get a reliable experience. And I don&#39;t just mean all the .NET Core things - full system update and <code>brew upgrade</code> are your friends</li>
<li>Don&#39;t use templates. Not many of them have been updated to 2.0 yet, you get no warnings about the ones which haven&#39;t, and enough has changed that it is very hard to update them manually unless you are a .NET Core expert already. (If you are, I suspect you&#39;re not reading this guide).</li>
<li>Don&#39;t try and update projects unless you know what you&#39;re doing; it cost me a lot of pain yesterday including bizarre internal compiler errors. On the happy news front, just copying across your actual code files works just fine.</li>
<li>Don&#39;t try and use Visual Studio (yet) - I&#39;m not going to go into this one as I&#39;m mainly talking to Mac users, but there has been issues there.</li>
</ul>

<p>With all that said and done, if I skipped using any templates and stuck exclusively to the bundled project options, the actual experience of using <code>dotnet</code> is very pleasant.</p>

<p>For example, setting up a brand new solution with library and test project looks something like below:</p>

<figure class='code'><figcaption><span></span></figcaption><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
<span class='line-number'>2</span>
<span class='line-number'>3</span>
<span class='line-number'>4</span>
<span class='line-number'>5</span>

<span class='line-number'>16</span>
<span class='line-number'>17</span>
<span class='line-number'>18</span>
<span class='line-number'>19</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class='sh'><span class='line'><span class="c"># Create solution file Project.New.sln in current directory</span>
</span><span class='line'>dotnet new sln -n Project.New
</span><span class='line'>
</span><span class='line'><span class="c"># Create library project in directory Project.New.Library</span>
</span><span class='line'><span class="c"># Default proj name is Project.New.Library.fsproj</span>
</span><span class='line'>dotnet new classlib -o Project.New.Library -lang f#
</span><span class='line'>
</span><span class='line'><span class="c"># And again for test library</span>
</span><span class='line'>dotnet new console -o Project.New.Library.Tests -lang f#
</span><span class='line'>
</span><span class='line'><span class="c"># Add projects to solution (can combine to a single line)</span>
</span><span class='line'>dotnet sln add Project.New.Library/Project.New.Library.fsproj
</span><span class='line'>dotnet sln add Project.New.Library.Tests/Project.New.Library.Tests.fsproj
</span><span class='line'>
</span><span class='line'><span class="c"># Set up test console app</span>
</span><span class='line'><span class="nb">cd </span>Project.New.Library.Tests
</span><span class='line'>dotnet add reference ../Project.New.Library/Project.New.Library.fsproj
</span><span class='line'>dotnet add package Expecto
</span><span class='line'><span class="c"># Update Program.fs to run tests (see https://github.com/haf/expecto#testing-hello-world)</span>
</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>

<p>At this point, running <code>dotnet run</code> in the test directory should run your example test, and running <code>dotnet build</code> from the solution directory should successfully build your nice, portable, shiny, .NET Core 2.0 code.</p>

<p>Enjoy, and remember this post has a shelf life: hopefully issues like the template woes I had should disappear quickly as the eco-system catches up with the latest release.</p>
