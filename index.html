  <div class="entry-content"><p><em>This post follows on directly from my previous post <a href="http://blog.mavnn.co.uk/type-providers-from-the-ground-up/">Type Providers from the Ground Up</a>. I highly recommend that you read that first, and check out the relevant example code from GitHub.</em></p>

<p><em>It&rsquo;s also a bit epic&hellip; grab yourself a coffee before you start.</em></p>

<p>So we have a working type provider now. Unfortunately, we&rsquo;re missing out on at least two major features that your new type provider will almost certainly want to make use of.</p>

<p>The first is that in our example, we&rsquo;re reading the metadata that defines our types from a fixed file location. In almost every real life case, you will want to be able to parametrize your provider to specify where this instance is getting it&rsquo;s metadata from.</p>

<p>The second is that in many cases getting the metadata will be slow, and the number of types available to generate may be very large. In these situations, you really want to be able to only generate the types that are required as they are requested, especially because this will reduce the size of the final compiled output. This is particularly important for type providers that read from large network based data sources like the Freebase provider.</p>

<p>We&rsquo;ll take the second first, because it&rsquo;s easy &ndash; and we like easy&hellip;</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I&rsquo;m a great fan of <a href="http://suave.io/">Suave</a> for simple web development in F#. I highly recommend checking out the site for details, but in the mean time I&rsquo;d like to share a little trick I&rsquo;ve been using for rapid prototyping that I&rsquo;m finding very useful.</p>

<p>The Suave.Http module contains a few helpers for serving static files from disk. Unfortunately, depending on use case and deployment strategy, relying on the location of a bunch of files on disk can be problematic.</p>

<p>So (open source to the rescue!) I cracked open the code and wrote a small alternative implementation that serves files from the current assembly&rsquo;s embedded resources. I&rsquo;m finding it especially useful for single page JavaScript apps where you have a small number of resources and then a lot of end points providing api functionality.</p>

<p>Setting up your website looks something like this:</p>

<p><a href="https://twitter.com/ad3mar">@ad3mar</a> if you feel like rolling this into Suave, you can consider it licenced under what ever is most convenient. An official licence file would make me much happier using Suave in production, by the way (hint, hint).</p>

<p>Edit: ad3mar has pointed out in the comments that Suave is already Apache2 licensed, I just failed to find the file last time I looked.</p>

<p>Tip one is in the case where you have XmlDocs to add to ProvidedTypes, ProvidedMethods and ProvidedProperties; in our case we have an optional description field in our metadata and the boiler plate was getting tiresome.</p>

<p>Thanks <a href="https://twitter.com/ovatsus/status/411496863591067648">Gustavo</a></p>

<p>Only issue is that having Python 3.x installed broke Octopress&#8217; Pygments support. Which kept me going for a while&hellip;</p>

<p>Given I&rsquo;m not currently doing any Python development, a uninstall and adding 2.7 to the path did the job.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p><em>This post is part of a series: <a href="/type-providers-from-the-first-floor/">part 2</a> follows on directly from this post.</em></p>

<p>In the ground tradition of blog posts as both documentation and augmented memory, I&rsquo;ve just added our first <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/b/dsyme/archive/2013/01/30/twelve-type-providers-in-pictures.aspx">Type Provider</a> to the code base. Time to write up the details before a) I forget them and b) anyone else needs to modify the code.</p>

<p>So, first things first. Before we get to the actual problem space at hand, let&rsquo;s try and provide a type. Any type&hellip;</p>

<p>1) Create yourself a new Visual Studio F# library project (2012 or up should work).</p>

<p>2a) Install the <a href="https://www.nuget.org/packages/FSharp.TypeProviders.StarterPack/">F# TypeProvider Starter Pack</a> or</p>

<p>2b) add <a href="https://raw.github.com/fsharp/FSharp.Data/master/src/CommonProviderImplementation/ProvidedTypes.fs">ProvidedTypes.fs</a> and <a href="https://raw.github.com/fsharp/FSharp.Data/master/src/CommonProviderImplementation/ProvidedTypes.fsi">ProvidedTypes.fsi</a> to the project as the first couple of files.</p>

<p>In either case, make sure that the .fsi file appears before the .fs file in your project listing, and that both appear before any type provider code &ndash; you will probably have to manually re-order them.</p>

<p>These are provided as code files rather than as compiled dlls due to complications with security and AppDomains when referencing dlls in the type provider assembly. For now just add them in &ndash; you really don&rsquo;t want to be re-creating the code in there by hand.</p>

<p>3) Replace the contents of Library1.fs with something like this:</p>

<p>So, that&rsquo;s great and it builds. We have a type provider class and an assembly that knows it&rsquo;s a type providing assembly. Unfortunately, it doesn&rsquo;t actually provide any types yet. Let&rsquo;s try it.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>So, a couple of weeks ago I went to the Brighton Functional Programmers meet up. It was a fun night, and at one point I ended up live coding in front of a room of functional programmers trying to give examples of lazy and strict evaluation.</p>

<p>The canonical go to tool for the job, is of course the infinite sequence and being stared at by a bunch of people and having syntax highlighting but no compiler, the first thing my brain pulled out of the air was this:</p>

<div><script src='https://gist.github.com/mavnn/7246744.js?file=Part1.fs'></script>
<noscript><pre><code>let ones =
    seq {
        while true do
            yield 1
    }
// seq [1; 1; 1; 1; ...]</code></pre></noscript></div>


<p>Which prompted one of the people attending (hi <a href="https://twitter.com/milessabin">Miles!</a>) to comment &ldquo;let&rsquo;s see that in Haskell without the bizarre looping generator&rdquo;. Roughly &ndash; I&rsquo;m slightly paraphrasing here given the couple of weeks in between. He has a bit of a point, this isn&rsquo;t the most functional looking sequence generator in the world, and it looks like quite a lot of code to just generate a lot of ones.</p>

<p>As always in these situations, I had of course thought of several other alternatives before I even reached my chair, so I thought I&rsquo;d have a quick survey of them and their advantages and disadvantages.</p>

<p>My first thought was that I&rsquo;d missed the obvious and succinct option of just generating a range. In F# (as in Haskell) the 1 .. 10 notation generates a list of the integers from 1 to 10. Unfortunately:</p>

<div><script src='https://gist.github.com/mavnn/7246744.js?file=Part2.fs'></script>
<noscript><pre><code>// Can't do this, unfortunately
// seq { 1 .. }
//
// or this:
// seq { 1 .. 0 .. 2 }
//
// Which I thought might be a nice hack.
</code></pre></noscript></div>


<p>Unlike Haskell, you can&rsquo;t have an unbounded range, nor can you set the &ldquo;step&rdquo; to zero to just keep on generating the same number. So you&rsquo;re limited to generating very big, but definitely not infinite sequences:</p>

<div><script src='https://gist.github.com/mavnn/7246744.js?file=Part3.fs'></script>
<noscript><pre><code>let notInfiniteOrOnes = seq { 1 .. System.Int32.MaxValue }
// seq [1; 2; 3; 4; ...]

let notInfinite = seq { for _ in 1 .. System.Int32.MaxValue -&gt; 1 }
// seq [1; 1; 1; 1; ...]
</code></pre></noscript></div>


<p>But hey! We&rsquo;re in functional world. So if we can&rsquo;t use sneaky built in syntax constructs, the next obvious choice is a recursive function:</p>

<div><script src='https://gist.github.com/mavnn/7246744.js?file=Part4.fs'></script>
<noscript><pre><code>let ones' =
    let rec gen () =
        seq {
            yield 1
            yield! gen ()
        }
    gen ()
// seq [1; 1; 1; 1; ...]
</code></pre></noscript></div>


<p>This is definitely infinite, and definitely functional in style. Bit verbose, of course, but it least it won&rsquo;t stack overflow as F# implements tail call recursion. It&rsquo;s verbose, but it does also have its advantages. It&rsquo;s trivial to pass things round in the recursive function (previous values from the sequence, etc) making this a very flexible way of generating sequences.</p>

<p>And, of course, let&rsquo;s not ignore the standard library. The <code>Seq</code> module gives us a couple of methods designed specifically for generating (potentially) infinite sequences.</p>

<p><code>Seq.initInfinite</code> just takes a function that returns a sequence value based on the index of that value:</p>

<div><script src='https://gist.github.com/mavnn/7246744.js?file=Part5.fs'></script>
<noscript><pre><code>let ones'' = Seq.initInfinite (fun _ -&gt; 1)
// seq [1; 1; 1; 1; ...]
</code></pre></noscript></div>


<p>As long as a simple mapping from index to value exists, this is both clear and concise. In theory, of course, it also suffers from the same issue as my range generators above: if your index exceeds the valid size of an Int32 you&rsquo;re out of luck.</p>

<p><code>Seq.unfold</code> may seem less intuitive, but in my mind is the more flexible and powerful solution. I tend to come across examples where it&rsquo;s easier to generate a sequence based on either some state or the previous term than by index, and that&rsquo;s exactly what unfold allows you to do:</p>

<div><script src='https://gist.github.com/mavnn/7246744.js?file=Part6.fs'></script>
<noscript><pre><code>let ones''' = Seq.unfold (fun _ -&gt; Some (1, ())) ()
// seq [1; 1; 1; 1; ...]
</code></pre></noscript></div>


<p>It will also happily generate sequences forever if your generating function allows.</p>

<p>So, how does it actually work? Let&rsquo;s look at a (slightly) more complex example that actually makes use of some state:</p>

<div><script src='https://gist.github.com/mavnn/7246744.js?file=Part7.fs'></script>
<noscript><pre><code>let moreInterestingUnfold =
    Seq.unfold
        (fun state -&gt;
            Some (state, state + 1)) 1
// seq [1; 2; 3; 4; ...]
</code></pre></noscript></div>


<p>What&rsquo;s going on here then? Well, <code>unfold</code> takes two arguments. The first is a function that takes a &lsquo;State and returns an Option&lt;&rsquo;T * &#8216;State>. In our simple example above, both &#8216;State and &rsquo;T are of type <code>int</code> but there&rsquo;s no requirement for them to be of the same type. If at any point the function returns <code>None</code>, the sequence ends. In our example, we always return <code>Some</code>, so our sequence is infinite (at least until it runs out of integers) and we&rsquo;re return a tuple of two values &ndash; the first of which will be used as the next term in the sequence, and the second which will become the new state.</p>

<p>The second argument to <code>unfold</code> is the starting state. In our case, this means the number that will be the first term in the sequence, and then we&rsquo;ll add one to it each time.</p>

<p>Let&rsquo;s round this out with an example that uses different types for the state and the terms of the sequence, which will hopefully now make some sense:</p>

<div><script src='https://gist.github.com/mavnn/7246744.js?file=Part8.fs'></script>
<noscript><pre><code>type Time =
    {
        Hour : int
        Minute : int
    }

let addMinute time =
    match time with
    | { Hour = 23; Minute = 59 } -&gt;
        { Hour = 0; Minute = 0 }
    | { Minute = 59 } -&gt;
        { Hour = time.Hour + 1; Minute = 0 }
    | _ -&gt;
        { Hour = time.Hour; Minute = time.Minute + 1 }

let unfold' =
    Seq.unfold
        (fun state -&gt;
            Some (sprintf &quot;%02d:%02d&quot; state.Hour state.Minute, addMinute state)
            ) { Hour = 22; Minute = 59 }
// seq [&quot;23:59&quot;; &quot;00:00&quot;; &quot;00:01&quot;; &quot;00:02&quot;; ...]
</code></pre></noscript></div>


<p>I&rsquo;m sure that you&rsquo;ve always needed a convenient way of cycling through every minute of the day repeatedly, with a nice readable string representation.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>So, as a follow up to <a href="" title="http://blog.mavnn.co.uk/teaching-f-number-to-c-number-devs/">this post</a> I&rsquo;m in the final stages of preparing a presentation for this Friday introducing an audience of (mostly) fairly experienced developers to F# and F# syntax. The main reason for this is to get a number of people up to speed enough on reading F# that they can have a better experience at <a href="" title="http://skillsmatter.com/event/scala/progressive-f-tutorials-2013">the Progressive F# Tutorials</a> at the end of the month. So the aim here isn&rsquo;t to get people fully autonomous and writing code <em>right now</em>, but to allow them to read the bulk of the example code in the tutorials and follow what&rsquo;s going on.</p>

<p>The general approach I&rsquo;ve gone for is to set up a Git repository that has a series of tagged snap shots I can check out as I work through the concepts I&rsquo;m planning to cover. This will enable me to actually demonstrate and run pieces of code, answer questions and make live modifications and then always jump back to a known starting point for the next section of the talk. Given the people involved have all done some .net development and I don&rsquo;t need to cover things like Visual Studio usage and projects, all of the code is contained in a single Program.fs file in a console app. I&rsquo;ve included the snapshot of the file from each tagged commit below, with a brief overview of what I&rsquo;m planning to introduce before skipping to the next snapshot.</p>

<p>With a full screen Visual Studio editing session, I should be able to make the code large enough to be visible and reasonably rapidly guide people to the areas where the code has changed.</p>

<p>A combination of the excellent <a href="http://papercut.codeplex.com/">PaperCut</a> project and a local &lsquo;http request to email&rsquo; service pretending to be an SMS sender, we should be able to see messages being generated by the code as we go along.</p>

<p>After the session, I&rsquo;m planning to mention <a href="https://github.com/ChrisMarinos/FSharpKoans">Chris Marinos&#8217; koans</a> and <a href="http://www.tryfsharp.org/">Try F#</a> (especially given that Rachel Reese is <a href="http://skillsmatter.com/podcast/scala/try-f-from-zero-to-data-science">running a session</a> at the tutorials for those who are going).</p>

<p>Please note that these are up here for comment and suggestions at this point &ndash; I&rsquo;ll be pushing up the actual Git repository and a screencast (I hope) after the event. The code is designed to be a prop for the talk rather than an independent resource &ndash; for that I&rsquo;d always point people to the koans/Try F# first.</p>

<p>So, show me the codez:</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><blockquote><p>But you are a chosen people, a royal priesthood, a holy nation, God’s special possession, that you may declare the praises of him who called you out of darkness into his wonderful light. <a href="http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=1%20Peter+2:9&amp;version=NIV">(1 Peter 2:9)</a></p></blockquote>

<p>Warning: this post may contain theology and other non-programming related
material. You have been warned&hellip;</p>

<p><a href="http://hrbc.org.uk">Our church</a> started a new sermon series last week, and as the
sermon was going on various other bits and pieces came together in my mind, and
I knew that I was going to have to at least try and get them down in writing or
they were going to run around my head for the next few days.</p>

<p>It comes up regularly for us as Christians that God isn&rsquo;t small enough to be
contained to Sunday mornings &ndash; he wants a larger part of our lives than that,
in fact the central part. But the idea of worshipping God with your whole
life often begins to get a bit weird when you actually stop and think about it.
Worship (&lsquo;to assign worth to something&rsquo;) is not a strange idea to any of us,
although we might not use that language &ndash; I&rsquo;m sure you can all think of a
respected author, favourite footballer or awe inspiring musician. And if you
buy into the whole Christian idea of who and what God is (infinitely powerful
and awesomely loving, perfect judge who offers grace, amazing sense of humour)
then the idea that a Christian is going to worship God also shouldn&rsquo;t seem that
strange.</p>

<p>But with your whole life? There&rsquo;s <a href="http://biblia.com/bible/esv/Romans%2012.1%E2%80%932">no doubt</a>
<a href="http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Deuteronomy+6&amp;version=NIV">biblically</a>
or in the teachings of both <a href="http://www.desiringgod.org/resource-library/sermons/all-of-life-as-worship">Christian teachers</a>
and <a href="http://www.jewfaq.org/prayer/shema.htm">Jewish tradition</a> that this is
precisely what is expected of us. But&hellip; when you write computer code as a day
job, what does that actually mean?</p>

<p>And then it struck me. It means being a <a href="https://people.gnome.org/~michael/">Michael Meeks</a> or a <a href="https://twitter.com/jonskeet/status/8423111419">Jon Skeet</a>. Probably not in the
specific details &ndash; I&rsquo;ve not met either of them personally, but in the attitude
they show to life and the people around them. If you&rsquo;re not in the programming
field (probably, if you don&rsquo;t happen to be in a similar area of the programming
field to me&hellip;) you&rsquo;re not likely to have heard of them. But they&rsquo;ve both
developed an enormous amount of respect in a field that is frequently full of
highly opinionated staunch atheists while being openly professing Christians.</p>

<p>So we wrap round to where we started &ndash; the idea from 1 Peter of
all Christians being priests. (I&rsquo;m not using the term here in the catholic
sense, so bear with me&hellip;). This comes up a lot when people relate one of the
core Christian doctrines &ndash; that people who have come into a relation with
Christ can come directly to God without an intermediary. But that wasn&rsquo;t the only
role of priests in the Old Testament. Yes, they were the only people who could
enter God&rsquo;s presence&hellip; but they weren&rsquo;t only going there for themselves. They
<em>were</em> the intermediaries, &lsquo;introducing&rsquo; others to God&rsquo;s presence, carrying
blessings from God to them and petitions from them to God.</p>

<p>Jon and Michael are dedicated to
what they do, they are good at it and they are &lsquo;graceful&rsquo;. In the sense that
they treat the people around them with respect and as professionals, teaching
and helping without regard to the others faith and without forcing argument and
discussion where it&rsquo;s not wanted. Both are obviously willing to talk to people
who want to (Michael even links to a fun page on <a href="http://christianthinktank.com/objedex.html">Christian Think Tank</a> for those who are
interested), but there isn&rsquo;t a pressure there.</p>

<p>And maybe that&rsquo;s what some small part of everyday worship looks like; I can&rsquo;t help feeling that by
being respectable (in the sense of, worthy of some respect) and making the fact
of their faith public, people like Jon and Michael have been doing their bit to
draw others closer to this God I worship. They&rsquo;ve caused a doubt and a second
look at what faith really means in the mind of those who would otherwise live
in an atheist bubble, carelessly dismissing the idea of God as the ramblings of
the obviously stupid and insane. Because these men are clearly neither.</p>

<p>This is encouraging to me, and I hope to a lot of out there who go to work, work hard
and tell people that you made it to church this Sunday. Because if you look
around you&rsquo;ll probably begin to see these people around you, the Jons and Michaels
who are making a difference just by living a life based on Christ&rsquo;s in the everyday.</p>

<p>And guess what? If you&rsquo;re a Christian, letting people know without pressure and
getting your coding/plumbing/teaching/building/etc. done you&rsquo;re probably making a difference
too. You might be the last to see
it, but I&rsquo;m sure others do.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>As part of writing up notes for introducing F# as a programming language to experienced C# devs I was looking for examples
of heavily OO code being implemented in F#. Then I realised that I&rsquo;d written at least one suitable example myself.</p>

<p>In the <a href="" title="https://github.com/mavnn/NuGetPlus">NuGetPlus project</a> I needed to implement a ProjectSystem class that was almost a direct copy of the MSBuildProjectSystem in the NuGet commandline client.</p>

<p>So without further ado, F# and then C# versions of a class with inheritance and which implements several interfaces.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>So, in a fit of enthusiasm my boss bought 15 tickets to the <a href="" title="http://skillsmatter.com/event/scala/progressive-f-tutorials-2013">London Progressive F# Tutorials</a> when he saw the early birds pricing (did I mention it&rsquo;s nice working here?). Several of the people who have been assigned tickets have asked to go largely because they are new to F#, so I&rsquo;ve been asked to put together a starter session to teach them the basics. I&rsquo;ve tried this <a href="" title="http://blog.mavnn.co.uk/an-introduction-to-f-screencast-and-pdf-slide">once before</a> and it was a fairly successful session (F# was adopted as a official supported language in the company partly due to feedback following it). But it was still pretty rough around the edges, and as normal with these things, you always want to do them better the next time round&hellip;</p>

<p>So, with a target audience of curious, experienced C# devs I&rsquo;m wondering about the best approach. The initial session needs to fit in an hour, although I can do individual follow ups afterwards.</p>

<p>My current thinking is to take a block of C# code (smtp sender?) that is fairly straight forward but &lsquo;production ready&rsquo; in the sense that it includes error handling, logging, etc. Then do a straight re-write in F# live coding. And then start refactoring to more idiomatic F# as we go along.</p>

<p>Features I feel would be important to cover:</p>

<ul>
<li>Basic syntax (let, functions, if &hellip; then, etc)</li>
<li>Common idioms (|>, Seq.map)</li>
<li>At least one computational expression (probably an error handling one; simpler than async in some ways)</li>
<li>Several examples of using the match statements</li>
<li>&hellip;which probably means at least one DU, possibly for error handling</li>
<li>Records and { &hellip; with &hellip; } expressions</li>
</ul>


<p>I&rsquo;ve got a week or two to prepare, so what I&rsquo;m really hoping for at this point is suggestions and ideas from people for how to improve this as a session idea, things that threw you when you first started writing F# you think should be covered, whether you think this is a stupid idea for a session from the concept up, etc. Once the session is completed I&rsquo;ll be posting the slides and hopefully a screen cast of it as I did last time for use by <a href="" title="http://fsharp.org">fsharp.org</a>.</p>

<p>Suggestions on the piece of C# code to translate would also be appreciated &ndash; either in terms of ideas of the type of code, or actual open source code that would serve as a code starting point.</p>
