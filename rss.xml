    <description><![CDATA[<p>
    This is something a little bit new. A series I'm starting that documents the building of a simple project from the ground up using a set of tools and techniques I've come to either really like, or that I'd like to try out.
    </p>

    <p>
    On the one hand this is a personal project. On the other, I'd like to take advantage of nice things like CI/CD, testing, etc, even when I'm working on something for myself. So this is also a mini-tour of many of the things I would do setting up a new greenfield project for a team.
    </p>

    <p>
    As the series progresses, I'll carry on adding the sections here.

    I'm not sure how far I'm going to take this experiment publicly, but what I'm going to focus on first is just the basics of any online app: people being able to sign up, log in, and manage an account for a paid service. At least that far the whole project will be MIT licensed, so if you like what you see you can just pick it up and use it as a starter template for your own project.

    For today, let's start with a <i>minimum deployable product</i>: a "Hello world" Falco server with CI/CD pipeline in place. We'll have a gitlab hosted project anybody with a working nix environment can pull down and:

    <div class="outline-text-4" id="text-1-11-1">
    <p>
    A nix "flake" is a declarative description of a set of packages we'd like to be able to reference. You can read the <a href="https://gitlab.com/mavnn/caldance/-/blob/6b39d13d98199220d623870faf2b49fbda58d8a5/flake.nix">whole file</a> but the important part for today is that our <code>flake.nix</code> file specifies three outputs in this stanza:

    <p>
    First we say we want a shell environment which includes the dotnet core SDK (version 8), nixfmt (for formatting nix files), and skopeo which we can use for moving docker images around.
    </p>

    <p>
    Then we define the default output for this flake: it uses the <code>buildDotnetModule</code> to specify that in our case it should build the executable <code>CalDance</code> based on the F# project file <code>CalDance.fsproj</code>. A helper makes sure that Nix is aware of which nuget packages the project has referenced, so that they can be packaged correctly.
    </p>

    <p>
    Finally, we define the <code>dockerImage</code> which uses the <code>dockerTools.buildImage</code> helper to say we want to be able to build a docker image that contains the executable from the default package above, everything it needs to run and <i>nothing else at all</i>. In our case, this produces a docker image weighing in at around 80MB - similar to what you'd get optimising a <a href="https://blogit.create.pt/telmorodrigues/2022/03/08/smaller-net-6-docker-images/">two step hand crafted dockerfile</a>, and significantly smaller than using the official <a href="https://hub.docker.com/_/microsoft-dotnet-aspnet/">Microsoft ASP.NET runtime image</a>.
    </p>
    </div>
    </div>

    <div id="outline-container-org3faadba" class="outline-4">
    <h4 id="org3faadba"><span class="section-number-4">1.11.2.</span> direnv</h4>
    <div class="outline-text-4" id="text-1-11-2">
    <p>
    Direnv is a tool that can add environment variables to your shell when you enter a directory. It also, conveniently, knows about Nix flakes.
    </p>

    <p>
    We add a <code>.envrc</code> file to our project with the contents:
    </p>

    <div class="org-src-container">
    <pre class="src src-bash"><span class="org-comment-delimiter">#</span><span class="org-comment">!/usr/bin/</span><span class="org-keyword">env</span><span class="org-comment"> bash</span>
    <span class="org-comment-delimiter"># </span><span class="org-comment">the shebang is ignored, but nice for editors</span>
    use flake
    </pre>
    </div>

    <p>
    Next time we move into this directory, direnv will ask us to allow this <code>.envrc</code> file. If we accept, our normal local shell will have everything specified in the <code>devShell</code> above added to its path. This means we can, for example, use the <code>dotnet</code> command and we will use the version specified in <code>flake.nix</code> even if we haven't installed a system wide version of dotnet at all.
    </p>
    </div>
    </div>

    <div id="outline-container-org55ce778" class="outline-4">
    <h4 id="org55ce778"><span class="section-number-4">1.11.3.</span> The F# project</h4>
    <div class="outline-text-4" id="text-1-11-3">
    <p>
    There's absolutely nothing special about this at all. I just created an F# project with <code>dotnet</code> on the command line, moved <code>Program.fs</code> into a sub directory called <code>src</code> because I prefer it that way, and then added a package dependency on <code>Falco</code> using <code>dotnet add package Falco</code>.
    </p>

    <p>
    Replace the contents of <code>Program.fs</code> with:

    <div class="outline-text-4" id="text-1-11-4">
    <p>
    Having used Nix for our development environment, our CI pipeline becomes exceedingly straight forward. All we need is a build container with Nix available and we have all the other information we need for the build already. Nix themselves provide a <code>nixos/nix</code> image (Nix is the package manager, NixOS is the linux distribution that uses Nix as its package manager) so we'll just use that.
    </p>

    <p>
    There's a little bit of boilerplate to tell nix that we want to allow flakes and to allow connection to the gitlab package registry. Once that is done, we log into the registry for this project using the CI provided environment variables, run <code>nix build .#dockerImage</code> and then push the results up to the registry.
    </p>

    <div class="org-src-container">
    <pre class="src src-yaml"><span class="org-variable-name">build-container</span>:

    <span class="org-variable-name">IMAGE_TAG</span>: $CI_REGISTRY_IMAGE:$CI_COMMIT_REF_SLUG
    <span class="org-variable-name">before_script</span>:
    - nix-env --install --attr nixpkgs.skopeo
    <span class="org-variable-name">script</span>:
    - mkdir -p <span class="org-string">"$HOME/.config/nix"</span>
    - echo <span class="org-string">'experimental-features = nix-command flakes'</span> &gt; <span class="org-string">"$HOME/.config/nix/nix.conf"</span>
    - mkdir -p <span class="org-string">"/etc/containers/"</span>
    - echo <span class="org-string">'{"default":[{"type":"insecureAcceptAnything"}]}'</span> &gt; /etc/containers/policy.json
    - skopeo login --username <span class="org-string">"$CI_REGISTRY_USER"</span> --password <span class="org-string">"$CI_REGISTRY_PASSWORD"</span> <span class="org-string">"$CI_REGISTRY"</span>
    - <span class="org-string">'nix build .#dockerImage'</span>
    - ls -lh ./result
    - <span class="org-string">'skopeo inspect docker-archive://$(readlink -f ./result)'</span>
    - <span class="org-string">'skopeo copy docker-archive://$(readlink -f ./result) docker://$IMAGE_TAG'</span>
    </pre>
    </div>

    <p>
    It's worth noting here that Nix is a deterministic build system (for example, stripping dates from compiled metadata so building the same source code on a different day doesn't product a different binary). In a "real life" context I would be caching the results of the nix build steps to a service like <a href="https://www.cachix.org/">Cachix</a> so that they could be reused between builds, which becomes increasingly useful as the project grows and starts to be comprised of multiple build steps (Nix will be able to cache each "step" individually, even if you only ask for the final outcome of the process).
    </p>
    </div>
    </div>

    <div id="outline-container-org16dac94" class="outline-4">
    <h4 id="org16dac94"><span class="section-number-4">1.11.5.</span> Wrapping it all up</h4>
    <div class="outline-text-4" id="text-1-11-5">
    <p>
    Not a bad first days work, I'd say. Our project is already at a stage that we can work on it with standard .NET tooling (for instance, adding a new nuget package with <code>dotnet package add ...</code> will automatically flow through to that package being added to the docker image) and CI will produce on push a lean deployable artifact. Versions of <i>everything</i> we are using from the .NET SDK to the nuget package we're depending on are fixed across all environments, and we have a nice place to add more developer tooling as we move forwards - for example standardizing the version of postgresql that will be used during development and in CI.
    </p>

    <p>
    As a bonus extra, anybody with nix installed can build and run the project without having to know .NET or have any .NET tooling installed; a very nice feature when you have others depending on your work who might want to run your code locally, but may not have chosen the same tech stack.

  These days I generally work longer term contracts, which means I'm not often available for the more immediate "pay money for a solved problem" services I could offer while I was consulting. Right now though, I'm between long term contracts.
  </p>

  <p>
  "But Michael," I hear you say, "what problems can I give you money to solve so that I can avoid distracting my own amazing team from actually <b>building the product</b>?"
  </p>

  <p>
  I'm so glad you asked. Or, you know, you can just skip straight to the <a href="#org93b1641">logistics</a> section if you already know what you want.

  Putting together a new project, or have a code base that's moving from "minimum viable" to "oh - I've got customers"? I can review your plans, or, given your constraints and objectives I can put together a suggested system architecture for you.
  </p>

  <p>
  It's worth noting that I don't have a personal axe to grind here. I won't tell you to use a "clean" architecture because that's my thing, or to use microservices because they are fashionable. Different architectural styles exist for a reason, and each has its own trade offs in terms of constraints you choose to accept in order to gain certain benefits.
  </p>

  <p>
  I have the advantage of having helped architect and design solutions in a variety of styles in production environments.

  <p>
  For ecosystems I've built decent sized projects in (.NET, TypeScript) I can spend some time reviewing your code and pointing out things you may want to improve.
  </p>

  <p>
  This isn't the kind of code review you'd do on an individual PR: this is the kind of code review where I can (as an outsider) come in with fresh eyes and point out broader patterns in your code base that may be problematic. I can also help you take your conventions and "traditions" and turn them into a coding style guide with (in many cases) automated tooling to help the team put it into practice.

  Considering buying a new service, picking up a new programming language, or changing to a new database library? I can do the research and evaluation you need based on your requirements. I've been helping drive technology choices in organizations for well over a decade now, and I can help you spot the good, the bad, and the ugly of the options you're considering. I may even be aware of options you haven't considered.

  Unlike more general consultancy, workshops on topics I know well such as the ones below are a fairly fixed commitment. If you're considering using your training budget, you can assume around 2500 euros/day for up to 6 people online. In person will increase the cost but allows for groups of up to 10 people.
  </p>

  <p>
  I have also offered bespoke training courses in the past (examples: giving a team of Ruby developers a 5 day crash course in everything they needed to know to take over maintenance of a .NET code base, tailored to the project in question) but that requires significant preparation and a quote.

  <div class="outline-text-3" id="text-2-11">
  <p>
  At its heart, the promise of domain driven design is simple: a code base that uses the same language as the people using it do, so that developers and domain experts can accurately share understanding of what the code <i>should</i> do and why.
  </p>

  <p>
  Actually <i>doing</i> domain driven design is not simple at all, because it is a process to help you model reality and it turns out <a href="http://johnsalvatier.org/blog/2017/reality-has-a-surprising-amount-of-detail">reality has a surprising amount of detail</a>.
  </p>

  <p>
  I can help with the process of getting started with DDD, help lead the early exploratory meetings between developers and domain experts, and give advice on how to capture what you discover in code while keeping everything maintainable.

  <h3 id="org53a56fc"><span class="section-number-3">2.12.</span> Event sourcing</h3>
  <div class="outline-text-3" id="text-2-12">
  <p>
  Event sourcing is a technique for capturing all the events that "have happened" and using those to calculate the current state of your system.
  </p>

  <p>
  For example, if a customer of yours moves you may publish a <code>CustomerHasMoved</code> event when they tell you, and a <code>CustomerAddressHasChanged</code> event when you have finished the business process that manages customers moving.
  </p>

  <p>
  This has enormous benefits for auditing, for being able to look at how the system has changed over time, and for being able to fix bugs "retroactively" as you don't only have the current state of the system but also all of the steps that got you here.
  </p>

  <p>
  It <i>also</i> requires a slightly different way of thinking about your code base and some specific tooling to avoid a system that slows down over time. And it affects how you think about business constraints like data retention and <a href="https://www.dataprotection.ie/en/individuals/know-your-rights/right-erasure-articles-17-19-gdpr">the right to erasure</a>.
  </p>

  <div class="outline-text-3" id="text-2-13">
  <p>
  I'm a huge fan of property based testing, and I'm more than happy to give interactive workshops on getting started with it in .NET, TypeScript, and probably other languages if you ask nicely. Why pay for this when you could download a conference talk about it for free (including ones I've given myself)? Because I'll use a piece of <i>your</i> code to get started with you will walk away with an up and running example in your code base. This will keep us focused on the reality of doing property based testing in practice rather than seeing the nice, easy, examples you tend to be shown in a 45 minute talk.

  <title>Writing CVs for more senior roles</title>
  <link>https://blog.mavnn.co.uk/2024/01/26/writing_a_cv.html</link>
  <author>michael@mavnn.eu (Michael Newton)</author>
  <guid isPermaLink="false">https://blog.mavnn.co.uk/2024/01/26/writing_a_cv.html</guid>
  <pubDate>Fri, 26 Jan 2024 00:00:00 +0100</pubDate>

  <description><![CDATA[<p>
  A while back (<i>checks notes, gulps</i>) I wrote a fairly successful <a href="https://blog.mavnn.co.uk/good-developer-cvs/">blog post on the types of CVs</a> I liked receiving as one of the people screening technical applications, and some of the mistakes I was seeing applicants making.
  </p>

  <p>
  What I didn't speak about at all was the "structure" of the CV; how to arrange it, and what sections to include/not include.
  </p>

  <p>
  Today somebody asked me for an actual CV for the first time in... quite a while actually. The last couple of jobs both had their own interview process that didn't include one, so that means it's been at least 5 years.
  </p>

  <p>
  Turns out that having been on the other side of the table a few more times now, and hiring for more senior candidates, my CV creation style has changed radically. The result is four broad categories of ways I've been effective in previous jobs, with a brief description of when I became senior enough to start doing that. So rather than having a big timeline of work history and education, I end up with things like:
  </p>

  <blockquote>
  <p>
  <b>Training and mentoring</b>
  </p>

  <p>
  For over a decade I have provided mentoring and training both to team members and as a service offered. This has ranged from people learning to code for the first time (CodeInstitute), to week long courses teaching professional developers new programming languages or architectural styles (@mavnn ltd), to giving talks at conferences on topics from the obscure to the philosophical (SDDConf, NDC, F# Exchange, Lambda Days, etc).
  </p>

  <p>
  Apart from formal training I have mentored teams several times during the introduction of new programming languages, libraries, and techniques (15below, NoRedInk, Blissfully/Vendr).
  </p>
  </blockquote>

  <p>
  Again - your mileage may vary; it's not like I've had any feed back on the application yet, or even that a single response tells you much about how the CV be received in general. But I can tell you that from the other side of the table that I'm much more interested in what <b>you</b> think are the areas you've made a difference, or that you're proud of, than I am in the job descriptions of your last 5 posts and where you went to secondary school.
  </p>

  <p>
  One slight caveat: I did include my LinkedIn profile, which has all the gritty dates and things. It just wasn't what I chose to highlight in the part of the process that I can control. Your CV is your chance to control the narrative - take it.

  <title>TypeScript Enums and Serialization</title>
  <link>https://blog.mavnn.co.uk/2022/11/24/typescript_enums_and_serialization.html</link>

  <description><![CDATA[<p>
  In general, TypeScript is <a href="../../../2022/01/07/types-in-typescript.html">not its own language</a> - it's a set of annotations that
  can be added to JavaScript to help check the "correctness" of you program. The
  authors have been very reluctant to add features to TypeScript that don't exist
  in JavaScript, and so normally you can turn your TypeScript into JavaScript purely
  by <i>deleting</i> the type annotations that you've added.
  </p>

  <p>
  Enums, though, are a bit different. They actually generate JavaScript code based on
  the TypeScript you write. Today, we're going to look at a piece of code that allows
  you to deserialize enums with string values in a type safe manner. And we're going
  to take advantage of the fact that enums (according to the TypeScript compiler) are
  both a type, and a value with a different type - at the same time.
  </p>

  <p>
  For context, we're going to be using <a href="https://www.npmjs.com/package/schemawax">SchemaWax</a> to create our decoder, so we can
  build it into a larger contextual decoder as needed.
  </p>

  <p>
  First: the code! If you already know SchemaWax, you don't care about types, and
  you're here because it was a hit for "deserialize any enum" on Google this is
  the bit to cut and paste.

  How does this work? How can we write a function that can take an enum type as an
  argument, and then generate a decoder? (Feel free to drop out if you were just
  here to solve your immediate problem!)
  </p>

  <p>
  If you type an enum into the online TypeScript playground (<a href="https://www.typescriptlang.org/play?#code/KYOwrgtgBAYg9nKBvAUFKB5EwoF4oBEc2BANGlACoDui+BALrWSgL4pA">here's one I prepared
  earlier</a>), you'll see that the enum (with string values) is, in fact, compiled
  into a variable that ends up with a simple record with string keys and values
  attached to it.
  </p>

  <p>
  Going back to the implementation, you'll see that's exactly the constraint on
  the argument we pass into <code>stringEnumDecoder</code>.
  </p>

  <div class="org-src-container">
  <pre class="src src-typescript">...
  <span class="org-keyword">export</span> <span class="org-keyword">const</span> <span class="org-variable-name">stringEnumDecoder</span> = &lt;Enum <span class="org-typescript-access-modifier">extends</span> <span class="org-rainbow-delimiters-depth-1">{</span> <span class="org-rainbow-delimiters-depth-2">[</span>name: <span class="org-typescript-primitive">string</span><span class="org-rainbow-delimiters-depth-2">]</span>: <span class="org-typescript-primitive">string</span> <span class="org-rainbow-delimiters-depth-1">}</span>&gt;<span class="org-rainbow-delimiters-depth-1">(</span>... rest <span class="org-keyword">of</span> implementation<span class="org-rainbow-delimiters-depth-1">)</span>
  </pre>
  </div>

  <p>
  Then some slightly weird magic happens: when you pass an enum into the function,
  the TypeScript compiler infers that the type of the argument is the <code>typeof</code> the
  enum you passed in. Whatever is happening internally here, it keeps track of the
  fact that the keys of this type are the types of the valid enum cases, so it
  turns <code>Enum[keyof Enum]</code> into the union type of each of the possible enum value
  types which is, if you squint hard enough, actually the enum itself. We then
  return a decoder that accepts a string, checks that said string is actually one
  of the <i>values</i> stored in the enum object, and then tells the compiler that this
  decoder will only ever return valid enum values. Unfortunately with a cast - but
  the full context we need to check this cast is valid is contained within this
  one line of code.
  </p>

  <p>
  So there you have it: a safe way to deserialize strings into enums, and it even
  composes nicely into more complex decoders.
  </p>

  <p>
  Until next time!
