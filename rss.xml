    After the initial set up work that builds our project and packages it for deployment done, it looked might it could be time to write some code. Given we're planning to use htmx, we're going to be spending a lot of time constructing urls to inject into our site that need to match end points on the server so a good starting point seemed to be building a set of helpers for defining "bidirectional routing".
    </p>

    <p>
    Adding the <code>Routing.fs</code> file to the F# project went exactly as you'd expect. We'll come back to this code when we test it properly, but to give you an idea we then updated the main server to actually start returning some HTML. The new <code>Program.fs</code> file new looks like this:

    <p>
    We now have two routes, one which starts with <code>greetings/</code> and then matches any string, and one which responds at <code>/</code>. You can see in index end point we use our new <code>htmxLink</code> helper to construct a link that will be matched by the greeting end point, and in the greeting end point we supply a handler that knows it is going to receive a string.
    </p>

    <p>
    This is all type safe, and that's lovely and all... but now we have two problems.
    </p>

    <p>
    Let's tackle the biggest problem first!
    </p>

    <div id="outline-container-org8b17705" class="outline-3">
    <h3 id="org8b17705"><span class="section-number-3">1.1.</span> Clarity and style</h3>
    <div class="outline-text-3" id="text-1-1">
    <p>
    Writing lists of lists is a succinct and powerful way of representing HTML, but it is also a pain in the backside to format nicely by hand. It's also very easy to bike shedabout, leading to a lot of wasted time and churn in commits.
    </p>

    <p>
    One of the best solutions to this is to automate code formatting following a reasonable style guide. This is especially important at the beginning of a project, or (ahem) when writing code you'd like people to follow as an example as it means all of the changes made to the project are because something meaningful has actually changed and there is a consistent style to follow along with.
    </p>

    <p>
    <a href="https://fsprojects.github.io/fantomas/docs/index.html">Fantomas</a> is the code formatter generally used by the F# community. We always want everyone to be using the same version and config, so let's build it into our <code>nix</code> configuration. The nix files we use to structure the set up of the repository are a programming language in their own right, so we can write a function to provide the correct version of Fantomas taking the version of the dotnet runtime as an input argument (we've put this in a separate file in the <code>nix</code> directory to keep things neat).
    </p>

    </pre>
    </div>

    <p>
    This basically says that we want to download a particular version of Fantomas from nuget (the dotnet package library), unzip it, and then create a shell script that uses our dotnet core runtime to run it. This works because Fantomas is built using an "any CPU" build configuration, allowing us to supply the correct runtime as needed by the system we're currently using but still executing the same compiled dotnet code. For a package that included any CPU specific code the normal nix approach is to download the source and then build it ourselves.
    </p>

    <p>
    Because we put the shell script in the <code>bin</code> directory of the output of this derivation (how nix refers to the definition of an enclosed package), this will be added to the path of any nix shell definition that depends on it. To make people's lives easier, we can also wrap it for common use cases which we do here to create the <code>format-all</code> and <code>format-stdin</code> commands.
    </p>

    <p>
    In our top level <code>flake.nix</code> file we can now import these tools and expose them to our developers:

    </pre>
    </div>

    <p>
    Now everybody has the same formatting tools available and an easy way to reference them. It even allows us to provide git hooks and/or attribute filters that users can choose to activate that will prevent unformatted code from being pushed or even format it as it is committed to the repository (check out the <a href="https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Customizing-Git-Git-Attributes">section on smudge and clean filters here</a> if you're interested).
    </p>

    <p>
    I'm normally quite keen on leaving the formatter settings on their default, but given the purpose of this particular repository I've also added a <code>.editorconfig</code> file to the repository to adjust the indentation to two spaces rather than the default four, and to reduce the aimed for line length to 60 characters to make it easier to read in the blog posts.
    </p>

    <div id="outline-container-org5421bdf" class="outline-3">

    <div class="outline-text-3" id="text-1-2">
    <p>
    Nearly as importantly as the code being readable is whether it actually works. <a href="https://github.com/haf/expecto">Expecto</a> is an F# unit test library that allows you to write executable test programs and defines tests as pieces of data rather than class methods with particular attributes. This can be insanely helpful in writing parameterized tests, which we'll get back to in a later post.
    </p>

    <p>
    Right now though, we just want the tests to exist and be run in CI.
    </p>

    <p>
    We'll start off by moving the existing server code into a directory called (<i>&#x2026; let the suspense build &#x2026;</i>) <code>Server</code>. Next to it we'll create an F# console project called <code>Server.Test</code> and use <code>dotnet add package</code> to add Expecto, along with YoloDev.Expecto.TestSdk and Microsoft.NET.Test.Sdk which allow the project to <i>also</i> be run by calling <code>dotnet test</code> so everybody's editors know how to run the Expecto tests.
    </p>

    <p>
    Finally, we add a project reference to <code>Server</code> from <code>Server.Test</code> and locally at least we're all set for running unit tests!
    </p>

    <p>
    Let's add one to <code>Program.fs</code>:
    </p>

    <div class="org-src-container">

    And then we can run it from the root of our project:

    &#10095;
    </pre>
    </div>

    <p>
    The current version of Expecto hasn't been updated to the latest FSharp.Core yet but it appears to work fine so we'll just keep an eye on that for now.
    </p>
    </div>
    </div>

    <div id="outline-container-org5476083" class="outline-3">
    <h3 id="org5476083"><span class="section-number-3">1.3.</span> Testing (CI)</h3>
    <div class="outline-text-3" id="text-1-3">
    <p>
    Now though, we have a problem. The promise of using Nix was that we wouldn't need to configure CI with lots of setup for things likes tests because our build environment is self contained, and that we could incrementally and deterministically build our sub-components. But now we either create a single nix derivation that has both our projects in, or we need to somehow package the tests separately. We don't want to create a joint derivation because we're compiling down our server code into a self contained enclosure including its own copy of the dotnet runtime.
    </p>

    <p>
    But we can't reference that build output directly from our test project, because it <i>is</i> built as a self contained enclosure but in the test project we want to reference it as a library in a different executable.
    </p>

    <p>
    This is where we play some slightly interesting tricks to get all the properties we want. Do you remember above, where we put the output of the Fantomas derivation in the <code>bin</code> directory to declare that the file in question was an executable? Turns out that we can also put a file in the <code>share</code> directory to signify that it is available to other derivations but is not directly used by any executables in this one.
    </p>

    <p>
    It also turns out that the way the F# helpers in nix manage incremental builds is by assuming that F# nix derivations will provide a Nuget package in the <code>share</code> directory. This means that we can build the server code once as a self-contained executable and put it in the <code>bin</code> folder, but we can <i>also</i> build it again without the self-contained flag and package it into the <code>share</code> folder by adding a hook to our derivation:

    We'll move the derivation into <a href="https://gitlab.com/mavnn/caldance/-/blob/adfe02a71f7193e93fdefd7518f465e592ead6d8/nix/server.test.nix">its own file</a> while we're at it to stop the main <code>flake.nix</code> file getting too confusing and noisy, and start passing in things like the dotnet core version and project name as variables to make it easier to keeps changes between components in sync.
    </p>

    <p>
    Aside: there is actually a helpful boolean flag that can be used to pack F# libraries but it fairly reasonably complains if you try and package a self-contained build.
    </p>

    <p>
    This in turn allows us to define a derivation for the <a href="https://gitlab.com/mavnn/caldance/-/blob/adfe02a71f7193e93fdefd7518f465e592ead6d8/nix/server.test.nix">test project</a> which looks very similar to the server derivation, just that it takes to server derivation as an argument so that it can declare a project reference on it along with all the previous arguments.
    </p>

    <p>
    <b>Quirk alert</b>: this works very, very, well giving us cached incremental builds but it does also require us to add a conditional <i>package</i> dependency on the server to our test project for the build to complete successfully under Nix. This means you end up with a project file that contains something like:
    </p>

    <div class="org-src-container">
    <pre class="src src-xml"><span class="org-nxml-tag-delimiter">&lt;</span><span class="org-nxml-element-local-name">ItemGroup</span><span class="org-nxml-tag-delimiter">&gt;</span>

    </pre>
    </div>

    <p>
    To finish off our test setup, we add a new output to our flake file - a request for a JUnit formatted xml file containing our test results.
    </p>

    <div class="org-src-container">
    <pre class="src src-nix"><span class="org-nix-attribute">packages.test</span> = pkgs.stdenv.mkDerivation <span class="org-rainbow-delimiters-depth-1">{</span>

    <span class="org-nix-attribute">version</span> = version;

    </pre>
    </div>

    <p>
    Now we can run <code>nix build .#test</code> in our root directory and we will get a result directory containing the test results (which will be cached unless the code of either the server or the test project changes).
    </p>

    <p>
    Some boiler plate additions to the GitLab CI configuration finishes things off; we tell the build to build both <code>.#dockerImage</code> <i>and</i> <code>.#test</code> (which nix will happily build run in parallel for us) and then copy the test results to a folder in the actual build directory which we tell GitLab contains junit xml results. This is needed because the <code>result-1</code> directory they are created in is a symlink to the a hash addressable store that nix uses, and it turns out GitLab's build artifact upload mechanism can't follow the symlink.

  <description><![CDATA[<p>
  This is something a little bit new. A series I'm starting that documents the building of a simple project from the ground up using a set of tools and techniques I've come to either really like, or that I'd like to try out.
  </p>

  <p>
  On the one hand this is a personal project. On the other, I'd like to take advantage of nice things like CI/CD, testing, etc, even when I'm working on something for myself. So this is also a mini-tour of many of the things I would do setting up a new greenfield project for a team.
  </p>

  <p>
  As the series progresses, I'll carry on adding the sections here.

  I'm not sure how far I'm going to take this experiment publicly, but what I'm going to focus on first is just the basics of any online app: people being able to sign up, log in, and manage an account for a paid service. At least that far the whole project will be MIT licensed, so if you like what you see you can just pick it up and use it as a starter template for your own project.

  For today, let's start with a <i>minimum deployable product</i>: a "Hello world" Falco server with CI/CD pipeline in place. We'll have a gitlab hosted project anybody with a working nix environment can pull down and:

  A nix "flake" is a declarative description of a set of packages we'd like to be able to reference. You can read the <a href="https://gitlab.com/mavnn/caldance/-/blob/6b39d13d98199220d623870faf2b49fbda58d8a5/flake.nix">whole file</a> but the important part for today is that our <code>flake.nix</code> file specifies three outputs in this stanza:

  </pre>
  </div>

  <p>
  First we say we want a shell environment which includes the dotnet core SDK (version 8), nixfmt (for formatting nix files), and skopeo which we can use for moving docker images around.
  </p>

  <p>
  Then we define the default output for this flake: it uses the <code>buildDotnetModule</code> to specify that in our case it should build the executable <code>CalDance</code> based on the F# project file <code>CalDance.fsproj</code>. A helper makes sure that Nix is aware of which nuget packages the project has referenced, so that they can be packaged correctly.
  </p>

  <p>
  Finally, we define the <code>dockerImage</code> which uses the <code>dockerTools.buildImage</code> helper to say we want to be able to build a docker image that contains the executable from the default package above, everything it needs to run and <i>nothing else at all</i>. In our case, this produces a docker image weighing in at around 80MB - similar to what you'd get optimising a <a href="https://blogit.create.pt/telmorodrigues/2022/03/08/smaller-net-6-docker-images/">two step hand crafted dockerfile</a>, and significantly smaller than using the official <a href="https://hub.docker.com/_/microsoft-dotnet-aspnet/">Microsoft ASP.NET runtime image</a>.

  <h4 id="org3faadba"><span class="section-number-4">2.12.2.</span> direnv</h4>
  <div class="outline-text-4" id="text-2-12-2">
  <p>
  Direnv is a tool that can add environment variables to your shell when you enter a directory. It also, conveniently, knows about Nix flakes.
  </p>

  <p>
  We add a <code>.envrc</code> file to our project with the contents:
  </p>

  <div class="org-src-container">
  <pre class="src src-bash"><span class="org-comment-delimiter">#</span><span class="org-comment">!/usr/bin/</span><span class="org-keyword">env</span><span class="org-comment"> bash</span>
  <span class="org-comment-delimiter"># </span><span class="org-comment">the shebang is ignored, but nice for editors</span>
  use flake
  </pre>
  </div>

  <p>
  Next time we move into this directory, direnv will ask us to allow this <code>.envrc</code> file. If we accept, our normal local shell will have everything specified in the <code>devShell</code> above added to its path. This means we can, for example, use the <code>dotnet</code> command and we will use the version specified in <code>flake.nix</code> even if we haven't installed a system wide version of dotnet at all.

  There's absolutely nothing special about this at all.

All we need is a build container with Nix available and we have all the other information we need for the build already. Nix themselves provide a <code>nixos/nix</code> image (Nix is the package manager, NixOS is the linux distribution that uses Nix as its package manager) so we'll just use that.
  </p>

  <p>
  There's a little bit of boilerplate to tell nix that we want to allow flakes and to allow connection to the gitlab package registry. Once that is done, we log into the registry for this project using the CI provided environment variables, run <code>nix build .#dockerImage</code> and then push the results up to the registry.
  </p>

  <div class="org-src-container">

  </pre>
  </div>

  <p>
  It's worth noting here that Nix is a deterministic build system (for example, stripping dates from compiled metadata so building the same source code on a different day doesn't product a different binary). In a "real life" context I would be caching the results of the nix build steps to a service like <a href="https://www.cachix.org/">Cachix</a> so that they could be reused between builds, which becomes increasingly useful as the project grows and starts to be comprised of multiple build steps (Nix will be able to cache each "step" individually, even if you only ask for the final outcome of the process).

  Not a bad first days work, I'd say. Our project is already at a stage that we can work on it with standard .NET tooling (for instance, adding a new nuget package with <code>dotnet package add ...</code> will automatically flow through to that package being added to the docker image) and CI will produce on push a lean deployable artifact. Versions of <i>everything</i> we are using from the .NET SDK to the nuget package we're depending on are fixed across all environments, and we have a nice place to add more developer tooling as we move forwards - for example standardizing the version of postgresql that will be used during development and in CI.
  </p>

  <p>
  As a bonus extra, anybody with nix installed can build and run the project without having to know .NET or have any .NET tooling installed; a very nice feature when you have others depending on your work who might want to run your code locally, but may not have chosen the same tech stack.

  <description><![CDATA[<p>
  These days I generally work longer term contracts, which means I'm not often available for the more immediate "pay money for a solved problem" services I could offer while I was consulting. Right now though, I'm between long term contracts.
  </p>

  <p>
  "But Michael," I hear you say, "what problems can I give you money to solve so that I can avoid distracting my own amazing team from actually <b>building the product</b>?"
  </p>

  <p>
  I'm so glad you asked. Or, you know, you can just skip straight to the <a href="#org93b1641">logistics</a> section if you already know what you want.

  I have spent a <i>lot</i> of time getting build, test, and deployment pipelines up and running. Most of the advice out there assumes that you are using one technology and you can just use "the build tool" for that stack. Reality tends to be more complicated than that, with many projects involving multiple languages, code generation, and extensive test set up.

  <div class="outline-text-3" id="text-3-7">
  <p>
  Putting together a new project, or have a code base that's moving from "minimum viable" to "oh - I've got customers"? I can review your plans, or, given your constraints and objectives I can put together a suggested system architecture for you.
  </p>

  <p>
  It's worth noting that I don't have a personal axe to grind here. I won't tell you to use a "clean" architecture because that's my thing, or to use microservices because they are fashionable. Different architectural styles exist for a reason, and each has its own trade offs in terms of constraints you choose to accept in order to gain certain benefits.
  </p>

  <p>
  I have the advantage of having helped architect and design solutions in a variety of styles in production environments.

  <p>
  For ecosystems I've built decent sized projects in (.NET, TypeScript) I can spend some time reviewing your code and pointing out things you may want to improve.
  </p>

  <p>
  This isn't the kind of code review you'd do on an individual PR: this is the kind of code review where I can (as an outsider) come in with fresh eyes and point out broader patterns in your code base that may be problematic. I can also help you take your conventions and "traditions" and turn them into a coding style guide with (in many cases) automated tooling to help the team put it into practice.

  <p>
  Considering buying a new service, picking up a new programming language, or changing to a new database library? I can do the research and evaluation you need based on your requirements. I've been helping drive technology choices in organizations for well over a decade now, and I can help you spot the good, the bad, and the ugly of the options you're considering. I may even be aware of options you haven't considered.

  Unlike more general consultancy, workshops on topics I know well such as the ones below are a fairly fixed commitment. If you're considering using your training budget, you can assume around 2500 euros/day for up to 6 people online. In person will increase the cost but allows for groups of up to 10 people.
  </p>

  <p>
  I have also offered bespoke training courses in the past (examples: giving a team of Ruby developers a 5 day crash course in everything they needed to know to take over maintenance of a .NET code base, tailored to the project in question) but that requires significant preparation and a quote.

  <div class="outline-text-3" id="text-3-11">
  <p>
  At its heart, the promise of domain driven design is simple: a code base that uses the same language as the people using it do, so that developers and domain experts can accurately share understanding of what the code <i>should</i> do and why.
  </p>

  <p>
  Actually <i>doing</i> domain driven design is not simple at all, because it is a process to help you model reality and it turns out <a href="http://johnsalvatier.org/blog/2017/reality-has-a-surprising-amount-of-detail">reality has a surprising amount of detail</a>.
  </p>

  <p>
  I can help with the process of getting started with DDD, help lead the early exploratory meetings between developers and domain experts, and give advice on how to capture what you discover in code while keeping everything maintainable.

  <h3 id="org53a56fc"><span class="section-number-3">3.12.</span> Event sourcing</h3>
  <div class="outline-text-3" id="text-3-12">
  <p>
  Event sourcing is a technique for capturing all the events that "have happened" and using those to calculate the current state of your system.
  </p>

  <p>
  For example, if a customer of yours moves you may publish a <code>CustomerHasMoved</code> event when they tell you, and a <code>CustomerAddressHasChanged</code> event when you have finished the business process that manages customers moving.
  </p>

  <p>
  This has enormous benefits for auditing, for being able to look at how the system has changed over time, and for being able to fix bugs "retroactively" as you don't only have the current state of the system but also all of the steps that got you here.
  </p>

  <p>
  It <i>also</i> requires a slightly different way of thinking about your code base and some specific tooling to avoid a system that slows down over time. And it affects how you think about business constraints like data retention and <a href="https://www.dataprotection.ie/en/individuals/know-your-rights/right-erasure-articles-17-19-gdpr">the right to erasure</a>.

  <p>
  I'm a huge fan of property based testing, and I'm more than happy to give interactive workshops on getting started with it in .NET, TypeScript, and probably other languages if you ask nicely. Why pay for this when you could download a conference talk about it for free (including ones I've given myself)? Because I'll use a piece of <i>your</i> code to get started with you will walk away with an up and running example in your code base. This will keep us focused on the reality of doing property based testing in practice rather than seeing the nice, easy, examples you tend to be shown in a 45 minute talk.

  <title>Writing CVs for more senior roles</title>

  <description><![CDATA[<p>
  A while back (<i>checks notes, gulps</i>) I wrote a fairly successful <a href="https://blog.mavnn.co.uk/good-developer-cvs/">blog post on the types of CVs</a> I liked receiving as one of the people screening technical applications, and some of the mistakes I was seeing applicants making.
  </p>

  <p>
  What I didn't speak about at all was the "structure" of the CV; how to arrange it, and what sections to include/not include.
  </p>

  <p>
  Today somebody asked me for an actual CV for the first time in... quite a while actually. The last couple of jobs both had their own interview process that didn't include one, so that means it's been at least 5 years.
  </p>

  <p>
  Turns out that having been on the other side of the table a few more times now, and hiring for more senior candidates, my CV creation style has changed radically. The result is four broad categories of ways I've been effective in previous jobs, with a brief description of when I became senior enough to start doing that. So rather than having a big timeline of work history and education, I end up with things like:
  </p>

  <blockquote>
  <p>
  <b>Training and mentoring</b>
  </p>

  <p>
  For over a decade I have provided mentoring and training both to team members and as a service offered. This has ranged from people learning to code for the first time (CodeInstitute), to week long courses teaching professional developers new programming languages or architectural styles (@mavnn ltd), to giving talks at conferences on topics from the obscure to the philosophical (SDDConf, NDC, F# Exchange, Lambda Days, etc).
  </p>

  <p>
  Apart from formal training I have mentored teams several times during the introduction of new programming languages, libraries, and techniques (15below, NoRedInk, Blissfully/Vendr).
  </p>
  </blockquote>

  <p>
  Again - your mileage may vary; it's not like I've had any feed back on the application yet, or even that a single response tells you much about how the CV be received in general. But I can tell you that from the other side of the table that I'm much more interested in what <b>you</b> think are the areas you've made a difference, or that you're proud of, than I am in the job descriptions of your last 5 posts and where you went to secondary school.
  </p>

  <p>
  One slight caveat: I did include my LinkedIn profile, which has all the gritty dates and things. It just wasn't what I chose to highlight in the part of the process that I can control. Your CV is your chance to control the narrative - take it.
