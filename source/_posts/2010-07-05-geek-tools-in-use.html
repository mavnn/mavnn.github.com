I&#39;m getting a new desktop machine sometime today or tomorrow for work, and need to leave the old one in something close to &quot;standard&quot; condition. Given all of the work for the next couple of days is web based I&#39;ve started the clear up now.<p /> Mostly for my own records, stuff I consider worth reinstalling on the new machine (current job is doing Windows development):<p />* Firefox (standard image still carries IE 6 *shudder*)<br />* WinSplit Revolution<br /> * Vim<br />* Powershell (needs to be installed *before* visual studio)<br />* Visual Studio 2010<br />* Executer (Nice little app launcher)<br />* &quot;Command Here&quot; XP Powertoy<br />* UK Dvorak keyboard layout<br />* Esc key registry hack (makes Caps Lock an extra Esc key, almost essential for Vim)<p /> Python is still sitting on the USB stick as well, just in case.
