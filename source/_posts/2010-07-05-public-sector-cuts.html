I&#39;m not sure yet if I agree with the public sector cuts of the current government: after all, they haven&#39;t announced what they are yet.<p />But am I the only person who finds the current Union rhetoric insane? <p /> There are already &quot;Oppose the cuts!&quot; posters up in my offices - do they really believe that no cuts at all are needed? That they should be opposed regardless of content? That the national deficit is some kind of made up problem that if it&#39;s ignored hard enough it will go away?<p /> I love the idea of unions, but in practice I find them so amazingly short sighted as organizations that they just make me cringe.
