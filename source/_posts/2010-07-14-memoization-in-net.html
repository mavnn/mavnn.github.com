      <blockquote class="posterous_long_quote"><p>Remember those <a href="http://budlight.whipnet.com/" target="_self">Real Men of Genius</a> Bud Light commercials on the radio?

<p>If they did one of these for Mads Torgersen, it would have to be:</p>

    <p>I don't remember the commercials, as it happens, but I agree with the sentiment (The original post that prompt this accolade is at <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/b/madst/archive/2007/05/11/recursive-lambda-expressions.aspx#">http://blogs.msdn.com/b/madst/archive/2007/05/11/recursive-lambda-expressions...</a>).
</p><p>Looking into .net memoization techniques (seemed useful when I'm likely to be using a lot of recursive functions and webservice calls in the near future) seemed like a good idea at the time, but now I'm beginning to fear slightly for my sanity. Y-Combinators indeed...
</p><p>And how do you pronounce memoize anyway?</p></div>
