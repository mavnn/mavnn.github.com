In f#, type inference suffers badly when calling methods on an instance of a class initiated outside of the function in question.<p /><div>I wonder if <a href="http://cs.hubfs.net/blogs/tomasp/archive/2006/07/07/413.aspx">quotations</a> would allow a general function &quot;xx&quot; to create functions &quot;xxmethodname&quot; such that:</div> <p /><div>xx -&gt; instance.methodname -&gt; xxmethodname</div><p /><div>xxmethodname instance [args] = instance.methodname [args]</div><p /><div>and if so how the type inference of the compiler would cope with it. </div>
