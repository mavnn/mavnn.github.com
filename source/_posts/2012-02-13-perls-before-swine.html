<p>Buried in the depths of our code base (.NET house) has been a single <br />Perl script, hacked together by an ex-college one afternoon to <br />eliminate an infrequent and boring (read: error prone) task. <p /> Which is great and all, but that 'infrequent' moment has arrived once <br />more, and none of the rest of us have Perl installed. None of the rest <br />of us really want to install it, either... <p /> An other afternoon later, and we now have an F# version of the script <br />checked into source control, and the first (and last) piece of Perl <br />has left source control. The new version is just as quick and dirty as <br />the old, but at least can be run on any of our machines. As a matter <br />of general interest, before and after versions below: <p /> Before: <p /> <script src="https://gist.github.com/1815931.js"></script><p /> After: <p /> <script src="https://gist.github.com/1815919.js"></script></p>
