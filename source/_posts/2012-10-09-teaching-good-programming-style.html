<p>So, I have several people from technical/mathematical backgrounds who are interested in learning more about programming, specifically with .net in some cases.</p> <p>Tooling is easy; Visual Studio Express, Monodevelop and Sharp Develop are all freely available.</p> <p>The question is, where would you start people off in terms of learning good, solid (see what I did there?) coding practices? Give them small projects and critique? Are there good open source projects for starters to get involved with? </p> <p>Given the intelligence and background of these people, teaching them syntax is the least of my worries: a basic tutorial and Project Euler will have them writing code that works in no time. Most of them even have &#39;toy project&#39; level skills in other programming languages. It&#39;s helping them learn how to build projects that work without falling into all the classic pitfalls of spaghetti code, or at least helping them climb out as quickly as possible.</p> <p>The thing that springs to mind (given there is several people) is to find a real world project that could be split into several &#39;trivial&#39; pieces that would need to communicate with each other; immediate opportunities to teach things like messaging, modularization and IoC (especially with some not very strict TDD built in). After the tutorial/Project Euler stage above, obviously.</p> <p>Suggestions? Other ideas? </p>
