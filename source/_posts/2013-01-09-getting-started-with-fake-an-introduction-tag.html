<blockquote><p>This is the first post in what will be a series about how we moved to
using <a href="https://github.com/fsharp/FAKE">Fake</a> for our build and testing
at <a href="http://15below.com">15below</a>. Feel free to follow along for the
ride. It&rsquo;s partly there as a way of keeping the full development group
within the company informed of what&rsquo;s going on, so it will get pretty
detailed and gritty in the later sections, but we decided that there
wasn&rsquo;t anything too company specific in here. So we&rsquo;re sharing it with
you all&hellip;</p></blockquote>

<p>At my current employer, we have a wide range of code all the way from
automatically translated vb6 (to vb.net) to brand spanking new F# and
C#. At the end of the day though, everything runs on .net 4.0
(currently).</p>

<p>With the newer components, we could in theory be building and testing
them independently: messaging based and developed in a TDD style they
tend to have an existing test harness around them and be easy to add
further tests to if it proves necessary.</p>

<p>The legacy code on the other hand, is a bit of a different matter.
It&rsquo;s still in the code base because it works. We know it works,
because customers are using it and getting value from it. The bits
that didn&rsquo;t, or looked like they were getting flaky, are the bits that
have been refactored as we went along. But they are old enough that
what is now considered basic testing hygiene was still a little more
than a twinkle in Kent Beck&rsquo;s eye. (Ok, ok, so the book had been
released. But it wasn&rsquo;t exactly considered common best practice yet).
So until the refactoring work is complete, we&rsquo;re stuck with a system
where the only feasible way of testing some aspects of it is to
actually deploy it somewhere and run some jobs through.</p>

<p>So what does this all have to do with Fake?</p>

<p>Well, basically our continuous integration was getting out of control.
To get the level of functionality and control we needed, we were
ending up with somewhere in the region of 500 lines of re-entrant,
recursive MsBuild scripts. I seriously considered starting the
alt.ms.build.die.die.die newsgroup. A full build on a developer&rsquo;s
machine could take upwards of 45 minutes. Even more painfully, as the
refactoring continued we ended up with TeamCity build configurations
tightly coupled to specific versions of our software, and it was
becoming clear that the whole CI system was going to rapidly collapse
under it&rsquo;s own weight unless things changed.</p>

<p>We needed a solution.</p>

<p>It had to be:</p>

<ul>
<li>Powerful. Programming in MsBuild is&hellip; not fun. Xml is for data.</li>
<li>Storable in git along with our source code.</li>
<li>.net based. We&rsquo;re a .net shop, and our specialist knowledge is .net;
rake wasn&rsquo;t going to cut it. We also didn&rsquo;t want the management
overhead of even more tooling on the build agents.</li>
<li>In active development.</li>
<li>Preferably open source, so even if external development stopped we
could continue to maintain it.</li>
</ul>


<p>As both the company F# evangelist and one of the two people doing most
of the CI work, I was very interested to hear about Fake, especially
after having a chance to chat to it&rsquo;s author (<a href="https://twitter.com/sforkmann">Steffen
Forkmann</a>) and having it recommended by
Don Syme (who wrote F#).</p>

<p>It met all of the criteria above. It&rsquo;s scripts are full F# &ndash; a
language fully supported by Microsoft within it&rsquo;s flagship Visual
Studio product. The scripts can easily be stored in git. It&rsquo;s actively
being worked on, and accepting contributions as a fully open source
product.</p>

<p>Time to give it a try.</p>

<p>Next post: how to set up your &ldquo;HelloWorld.fsx&rdquo; Fake script with your
source, with all the niceties like intellisense that you would want.</p>
