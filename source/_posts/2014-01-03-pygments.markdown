Apparently I should be able to do inline F# code using one of the Octopress plugins, rather than having to use gists every where.

Let's try it:

``` fsharp
let hello = "world"
```

Only issue is that having Python 3.x installed broke Octopress' Pygments support. Which kept me going for a while...

Given I'm not currently doing any Python development, a uninstall and adding 2.7 to the path did the job.
