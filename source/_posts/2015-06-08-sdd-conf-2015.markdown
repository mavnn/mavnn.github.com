So, nearly a month back now I had the fantastic opportunity to speak at this year's
[Software, Design & Development](http://sddconf.com/) at the Barbican on property based
testing - or more specifically, FsCheck.

<!-- more -->

It was a fun experience and a very different type of conference to the smaller, generally
open source community based events that I normally attend. There were a wide variety of
expert speakers, covering the whole range from people like myself presenting on potentially
useful but relatively unknown technology (in the enterprise world, at least -
property based testing is pretty well known in functional programming circles) through to
known industry names.

I won't go into the details of all the talks I attended as I was there for 3 days. But there
were a lot of good ideas on display ranging through sane naming (always worth watching
anything by [Kevlin Henney](https://twitter.com/KevlinHenney) if you get a chance) to
project design (as opposed to project planning, probably more thoughts on that later) to
practical DDD examples in .net to the "Zen of Architecture".

As a thank you
to [Kurt Schelfthout](https://twitter.com/kurt2001) who wrote FsCheck, to spread further what
I think is an awesome concept and to give an idea
of some of the kind of things we do at [15below](http://www.15below.com/) to any interested
developers I managed to arrange for the recording of my talk to be released publicly. It's
an unmanned camera, so you have a pretty good view of the slides with out having to see my
face at any point, which many people will see as an advantage! I strongly recommend full
screen viewing; there's a fair amount of code in the presentation.

If you want to play with the code from the demo yourself, it's available [on Github](https://github.com/mavnn/SddConf2015).

Many thanks to the conference organisers [Yellowstone TechMedia](http://www.yellowstonetechmedia.com/), and I'll definitely be considering submitting talks/attending again next year.
