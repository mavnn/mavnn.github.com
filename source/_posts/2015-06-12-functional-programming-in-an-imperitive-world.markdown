Yesterday was the [Functional Programming Exchange 2015](https://skillsmatter.com/conferences/7036-functional-programming-exchange-2015#skillscasts) and this being SkillsMatter,
the videos are already up. It's a great place to talk from that point of view, with consistently excellent organisation.

I was talking on being a "Functional Programmer in an Imperative World"; the slides are embedded below, but for the full experience check out the video at the link above.
