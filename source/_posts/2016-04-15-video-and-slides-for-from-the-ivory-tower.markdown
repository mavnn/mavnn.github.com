I spoke this morning at [F# Exchange](https://skillsmatter.com/conferences/7145-f-exchange-2016#program) and this being SkillsMatter they've published the recording already.

It's a nice short talk, weighing in at about 15 minutes. So grab yourself a coffee and
take a short tour of how some of F#'s more esoteric features (active patterns, computational expressions,
quotations and type providers) have been used to solve real problems in the real world.
