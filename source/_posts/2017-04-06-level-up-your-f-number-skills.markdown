@mavnn ltd have always offered training as a service, but we're now pleased
to announce our very first public training event. As readers of this blog (or people attending [F# Exchange](https://skillsmatter.com/conferences/8053-f-sharp-exchange-2017#skillscasts)), you
get first notification!

"Level Up Your F#" is going to be a two day course running in London on the 15th-16th June.
We'll run through a syllabus of language features unique to F# and not shared by
the other dotnet languages - features that offer unparalleled expressive power 
at the cost of a learning curve and the occasional sharp edge. In the course we'll
give you a leg up that curve, and protect you from a few cuts along the way.

This course will be aimed at people who have spent some time coding in F#
(possibly after taking a course like the "[Fast Track to F#](https://skillsmatter.com/courses/473-tomas-petricek-phil-trelford-fast-track-to-fsharp#overview)") and realise that their
projects could benefit from a deeper understanding of F# special
abilities. These techniques are especially useful for writing generic,
reusable code - whether that's core internal code or widely used libraries.

It will be a small group, allowing for personalization and some flexibility in design,
but at its core it will be build up through four major topics:

1. Useful tricks: active patterns, member constraints, etc

2. Quotations: what they are, and how and when to use them

3. Type Providers: how to build them, and use them for type safety

4. Computational Expressions: build powerful abstractions and then expose them in an easy to use way

We're aiming for a cost of Â£1,295.00 for the course with early bird (<strike>10</strike> 15% until the 15th May) and group discounts available (contact [us](mailto:us@mavnn.co.uk)). Due to the nature of the course, there will be a hard limit of 12 attendees. There's also a limited quantity of super-early bird tickets available if you're quick! Register your interest soon to secure a ticket, and if there's a waiting list we'll consult you about
additional dates.

As always with @mavnn training courses, we're also willing to come and deliver this training on site and tailor it to your specific needs. Contact us at [us@mavnn.co.uk](mailto:us@mavnn.co.uk) to discuss requirements and quotes.

### Details:

## How do I book?

We're selling tickets via [eventbrite](https://www.eventbrite.co.uk/e/level-up-your-f-skills-tickets-33720450776).

## Prerequisites

We will expect attendees to be familiar with F# syntax, including the use of discriminated unions and computational expressions such as async. Other concepts will be explained and explored during the course.

## What to bring

You will need to bring your own computer with a F# development environment already
installed. VS Code, Visual Studio, Vim, other editor that doesn't begin with "V": 
all are fine as long as you can write and compile F# code on the machine. Extra drink
token for anyone who brings a Raspberry Pi as their dev environment!

## What you'll get

2 days of workshops guiding you through the unique features of F#, along with code
and exercises to take away with you.

Breakfast, coffee, lunch, and dinner provided within the course costing including
a round of drinks for the evening of the first day.

## Where will it be

At the [Wellcome Collection](https://wellcomecollection.org/), right next to Euston Station.
