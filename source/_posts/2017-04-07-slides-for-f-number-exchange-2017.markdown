My "slides" from my talk at F# Exchange were actually just a set of .fsx scripts this year, enabling me to play a bit live during the presentation.

If you're interested you can find them on my github account at [https://github.com/mavnn/FSharpX2017](https://github.com/mavnn/FSharpX2017).

Have fun!
