As mentioned on the blog already, I had the opportunity to talk at this year's F# Exchange at [skillsmatter](https://skillsmatter.com/). As always, they've done an excellent job on the video production, so if you're interested in what makes F# different from other programming languages have a watch of [Fixing Real Life Problems From the Ivory Tower](https://skillsmatter.com/skillscasts/9883-fixing-real-life-problems-from-the-ivory-tower) (free log in required).

If you like the talk and would like to learn more, these are also the subjects that I'll be covering in my recently announced [Level Up Your F#](/level-up-your-f-number-skills/) course, which will be running for 2 days in London on the 15th-16th June.
