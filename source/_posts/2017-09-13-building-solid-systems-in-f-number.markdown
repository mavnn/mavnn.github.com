We are running another course, and I'm officially stoked! Read on for the details...

<h2>Building Solid Systems in F#</h2>

Writing code is only the first part of putting software into production - to run, maintain and scale your product, you'll need to understand and design the overall system.

This 2 day course will take you through best practice in both writing an F# based, distributed system and running it in production - including sensible inter-operation with components written in other languages.

To fit this into 2 days, we'll need to make some opinionated decisions (such as using F#!), but many of the ideas and concepts will be transferable. 

**We'll cover:**

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Writing reliable code using F#'s unique language features</li>
<li>Learn how to apply SOLID (like) principles in a functional style</li>
<li>How to instrument distributed services</li>
<li>Continuous Improvement: 
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Unit testing</li>
<li>Performance measurement</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Running distributed systems in development</li>
<li>Deploying distributed systems to production</li>
<li>Good practice in dependency management and code organization</li>
</ul>

**You'll come away with:**

<p>
A git repository of your completed work, which will include:
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Nicely instrumented, benchmarked and unit tested F# services</li>
<li>A scripted, deterministic deployment process for the overall distributed system</li>
<li>Real time centralized logging, metrics and health feedback from the system, whether running on the dev machine or in production</li>
<li>Zero down time continuous deployment for the overall system</li>
</ul>

**Prerequisites:**

<p>
You need to have:
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>a basic knowledge of F# syntax</li>
<li>a reasonable background knowledge of software development</li>
</ul>

<p>
You need to bring laptop with:
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>a relatively recent F# development environment (you'll need to be able to build dotnet core 2.0 apps)</li>
<li>minikube installed</li>
</ul>

<p>
We'll also ask you to pre-download some code and containers in advance so that we can hit the ground running on the first day; we'll pass you the details of that before the event.

**Is this a replacement for Level Up Your F#?**

No; [Level Up Your F#](https://blog.mavnn.co.uk/level-up-your-f-number-skills/) focussed on the details of the F# language, this course is focussed on building systems. We will be running Level Up Your F# again in the future.

**What have other people said about your courses?**

Hassan Ezzahir, Lead developer (Contractor) at BNP Paribas

> I’ve been trying to learn F# for several years now and got almost all
> the existing books on the subjects.
> 
> Yet, I felt there was a gap between my good understanding of the
> language and actually applying it on bigger “real” projects.
> 
> Michael’s great training skills has enabled me to quickly practice some
> advanced topics I was less familiar with.
> 
> With my newly acquired knowledge, I’m confident I will be able achieve
> some great (and fun) developments with F#

Alexander Battisti, Senior Software Developer (Machine Learning) at Freeletics GmbH

> I found "Level Up your F#" a good course teaching advanced topics in
> F# that are commonly ignored or glossed over when you are on your own,
> but are useful enough so you shouldn't ignore them. The exercises were
> difficult in a good way and engaging. I definitely recommend the
> course for anybody after they took their first serious steps in
> learning F#.
