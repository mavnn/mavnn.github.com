We are running an other course, and I'm officially stoked! Read on for the details...

<h2>Building Solid Systems in F#</h2>

<p>
Writing code is only the first part of putting a software system into production; some of these rules are universal across software development, some depend on your ecosystem and operating system, and some are unique to each programming language.
</p>

<p>
This course will take you through best practice in both writing and running an F# based system in production, including sensible inter-operation with components written in other languages.
</p>

<p>
<em>We'll cover:</em>
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Writing reliable code using F#'s unique language features</li>
<li>Learn how to apply SOLID (like) principles in a functional style</li>
<li>How to instrument distributed services</li>
<li>Continuous Improvement: 
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Unit testing</li>
<li>Performance measurement</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Running distributed systems in development</li>
<li>Deploying distributed systems to production</li>
<li>Good practice in dependency management and code organization</li>
</ul>

<p>
Obviously to fit this in to a two day course, we'll be making some opinionated decisions around libraries and technologies to use.
</p>

<p>
<em>You'll come away with:</em>
</p>

<p>
A git repository of your completed work, which will include:
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Nicely instrumented, benchmarked and unit tested F# services</li>
<li>A scripted, deterministic deployment process for the overall distributed system</li>
<li>Real time logging, metrics and health feedback from the running system on the dev machine and in production</li>
<li>Zero down time continuous deployment for the overall system</li>
</ul>

<p>
<em>Prerequisites:</em>
</p>

<p>
You need to have:
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>a basic knowledge of F# syntax</li>
<li>a reasonable background knowledge of software development</li>
</ul>

<p>
You need to bring laptop with:
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>a relatively recent F# development environment (you'll need to be able to build dotnet core 2.0 apps)</li>
<li>minikube installed</li>
</ul>

<p>
We'll also ask you to pre-download some code and containers in advance so that we can hit the ground running on the first day; we'll pass you the details of that before the event. 
</p>

_Is this a replacement for Level Up Your F#?_

No; [Level Up Your F#](https://blog.mavnn.co.uk/level-up-your-f-number-skills/) focussed on the details of the F# language, this course is focussed on building systems. We will be running Level Up Your F# again in the future.

_What have other people said about your courses?_

Hassan Ezzahir, Lead developer (Contractor) at BNP Paribas

> I’ve been trying to learn F# for several years now and got almost all
> the existing books on the subjects.
> 
> Yet, I felt there was a gap between my good understanding of the
> language and actually applying it on bigger “real” projects.
> 
> Michael’s great training skills has enabled me to quickly practice some
> advanced topics I was less familiar with.
> 
> With my newly acquired knowledge, I’m confident I will be able achieve
> some great (and fun) developments with F#

Alexander Battisti, Senior Software Developer (Machine Learning) at Freeletics GmbH

> I found "Level Up your F#" a good course teaching advanced topics in
> F# that are commonly ignored or glossed over when you are on your own,
> but are useful enough so you shouldn't ignore them. The exercises were
> difficult in a good way and engaging. I definitely recommend the
> course for anybody after they took their first serious steps in
> learning F#.
