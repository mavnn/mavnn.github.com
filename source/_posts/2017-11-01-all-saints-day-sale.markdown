> TL;DR: 10% off [Building Solid Systems in F#](/building-solid-systems-in-f-number/) until 7th November 2017

Lots of people these days seem to like giving Halloween sales, but historically and theologically, Halloween is really just the precursor to the real celebration: [All Saints' Day](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/All_Saints%27_Day).

So in the interest of getting the details right, we're having an All Saints' Day sale, starting today for 7 days. It's already live, get your 10% off [your tickets](/building-solid-systems-in-f-number/) now.
